If it was such a gigantic factor in the SB run, as some make it out to be, it would have resulted in some points on the board!

You have a valid point about the o-line, but that doesn't fully explain xxnumber TDs the entire year vs. xxnumber interceptions (not even close). The offense was terrible, and Peyton's decline was a large part of that. Anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves.
