      "As we await the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in the Tom Brady case and whether Roger Goodell’s powers over player conduct will be sanctioned or again rebuked, those powers received an endorsement from an arbitrator last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the volatile fall of 2014—with league missteps in the Ray Rice case and harried handlings of situations involving Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy—the NFL recast its efforts in discipline, culminating with a new personal conduct policy announced at an owners meeting that December. The league sought input from many sources in formulating the policy: women’s groups, military, corporate and, begrudgingly, the NFLPA. The union’s input, however, was limited and ultimately ignored, and the NFLPA ultimately filed a grievance after being disregarded in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NFLPA challenged the system, invoked clumsily in the Peterson and Hardy cases, that allows players to be put on leave with pay and the use of the commissioner’s exempt list. The NFLPA claimed that those tactics amounted to “discipline” and argued, as we noted often during the Peterson and Hardy situations, that the exempt list had never been used for this purpose, and thus doing so required bargaining with the union. The NFLPA also challenged the commissioner’s delegating of the initial application of punishment to a disciplinary officer (currently Todd Jones, former Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). Finally, the union objected the NFL’s use of consultants, experts and advisors and differed in treatment and counseling methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ruling is a strong endorsement of the commissioner’s continuing powers in the area of player conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "After months-long settlement negotiations broke off a couple of weeks ago, arbitrator Jonathan Marks ruled on Sunday that the policy’s features of leave with pay and the exempt list are within the commissioner’s CBA powers. Rather than terming those statuses “discipline,” as the NFLPA had argued, the arbitrator ruled that they were essentially “cooling-off” periods for the player, allowing for the commissioner to further evaluate whether the conduct was detrimental before applying discipline. The arbitrator further endorsed the NFL’s use of its many experts and advisors in this area (the league has hired several in the domestic violence area alone). Simply, the ruling is a strong endorsement of the commissioner’s continuing powers in the area of player conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NFLPA did “win,” however, in two areas. On the issue of the commissioner’s delegation to Jones or any other disciplinary officer, the arbitrator disallowed such delegation. Other figures, such as the disciplinary officer, can advise and recommend punishment but cannot actually punish; that is the sole province of the commissioner. Also, although placement on the exempt list was not ruled to be discipline, the NFL must provide the player and the NFLPA with notice of being placed on the list and an opportunity for a hearing with counsel as to the reasons for such placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "• THE WHEN AND WHAT’S NEXT OF THE DEFLATEGATE RULING: Andrew Brandt looks at what’s going on behind the scenes in the Tom Brady case, and what it might mean\n",
      "\n",
      "As often said in the space, we have a 10-year labor agreement in the NFL, but we have hardly had labor peace during the first half of that CBA. Although it appeared the NFLPA had an opening for inclusion into the disciplinary process in 2014 after the Rice mistakes, that window quickly closed. The NFL essentially ignored the union and enacted the policy. Then, as so often happens with these two sides, came the lawyers. The arbitrator pleaded for the two sides to settle this matter without his intervention, but, to no one’s surprise, settlement talks broke down. Thus we have this ruling: The NFL can legally proceed with its policy and its concepts of leave with pay and an exempt list. Roger Goodell can continue to use those powers expanded by the new policy. The reign of the Conduct Commissioner persists.\n",

      "How confident is Chevrolet that the Camaro SS can withstand the worst punishment its owners can dish out? The car maker is so bullish on their V-8-powered muscle car's capabilities, it will happily pick up the tab if any mechanical malfunctions arise while running hot laps around a track.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's direct from Camaro chief engineer Al Oppenheimer, who handed the word down to Motor Authority at the 2016 New York Auto Show. \"[If] you take your production car to a track day and you have an issue with one of your parts, it's covered under warranty,\" Oppenheimer told the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chevrolet has covered track-related malfunctions on the Camaro in the past, but in previous-generation vehicles, it only did so on the ZL1 and Z/28 models. As of 2016, though, Oppenheimer says the generous umbrella of track-day GM warranty coverage extends over every model from the SS on up. For now, that includes the SS, the ZL1, and the 1LE.

      "Ten years ago, someone I knew drove me home from a party and took advantage of me. Most people would call it rape. Back then, that word was too scary for me. I thought that if it was someone I knew, maybe it wasn't rape; I thought since I got in his car, it might be my fault. I was 18 and didn't even want my family knowing I kissed boys, so uttering the word rape to anyone was out of the question. I couldn't imagine the embarrassment of telling my parents, my doctor, or police.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had gone to the party together, and I sat at a counter by myself most of the night while he drank with his friends on the other side of the kitchen. After a couple of hours of failing to mingle, I couldn't bear the social anxiety that came over me and I wanted to go home. I was grateful that he had no problem leaving to take me home.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a really nice car; I remember getting in and thinking about how I couldn't believe a guy like him would take me to a party. We talked comfortably with all the windows down as we drove; I was comfortable enough that I closed my eyes. I opened them a couple of minutes later when I realized we had come to a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked around. It was pitch black, and all I could hear was crickets — then my voice yelling \"no\" and \"stop.\" He forced himself on me and repeated the words \"I'm sorry\" over and over until he was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to get out of the car, but I was in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, and I was in a state of shock that seemed to last for weeks. He drove me home and kept asking if I was mad at him and repeating that he was sorry and how he thought he might be in love with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "For weeks, I didn't want to go anywhere or talk to anyone. A friend called me and begged to know what was wrong. I told him, \"I think I was raped.\" It was the first time I had ever spoken that word and once I did, the pain it unleashed made a permanent habitat in my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept very busy. I worked multiple jobs that kept me occupied seven days a week, but every Sunday afternoon, after coming home and showering, I would cry in my bed all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw him at a party about a year later and could feel him looking over his shoulder at me, watching me. I couldn't stand to be in my own memories with him, never mind the same room. As I stormed out, I stopped in front of him and, eyes glaring, said \"Don't you ever look at me again, and if you know I'm going to be somewhere, I advise you don't show up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Drunk, he called out, \"Maybe you should have called the police that night then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I keyed the whole side of that fucking car to the tune of him and his friends laughing after me. I stopped going to parties after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stopped a lot of things, like making eye contact with men. As love interests entered my life, I learned that I could not handle physical touch. I didn't even like people holding my hand. When I had sex, I had to put all my focus into the moment or else I would have flashes of that night in his car. It would cause me to freak out and leave. Crickets — I still don't like the sound of them. In these flashbacks, every detail was so clear. I could hear the song playing on the radio and the color of my undergarments. I could remember the sickening smell of beer on his breath. I would sometimes have these flashes while I was driving. One time I almost lost control on the highway; I remembered not being phased by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "These side effects continued for years, and crawling out of the dark hole I was in wasn't easy, but I eventually learned how to heal myself through counseling, time, and trust. I even began a ritual where I would only let myself think about it once a week at spin class. I would then drive to the track and run a mile or so and cry before getting in my car, ripping up a picture of him, and throwing it into the wind as I drove away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until many relationships and years later that I finally felt \"over it,\" whatever that means. It wasn't a specific day or moment, but a period when I just felt OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years after that, I got a very unexpected friend request on Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart pounded when I saw his name. You have got to be shitting me. I felt so many emotions rushing back, and I weighed my next move carefully. Part of me wanted to ask him who the hell he thought he was, and another part of me wanted to ignore it and say nothing, like I had years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to do something different this time and confront him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What I initially took from this exchange was a lot of disgust. I felt like he was trying to cash a free pass for all of his wrongdoings now that he was in AA. I saw it as the most generic, half-assed apology I have ever read. Did he wait a decade to approach this now that he has something to blame his actions on? Is that really taking responsibility? What might have cleared his conscience filled my mind with painful memories, and I wasn't OK with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days passed, I kept thinking about our messages and the idea of acceptance. He says he's a recovering alcoholic making amends, and I know him as the kid that raped me and didn't give a shit until 10 years later (if you can even call that giving a shit). I knew my reply to him was true, that I didn't need his apology. When it comes to letting go of anger, I didn't wait for an apology to move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, I had to at least accept the situation for what it was, and that night was long in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ended that message with \"I understand and wish the best for you,\" and to my own surprise, I replied, \"Same to you.\" Whether I mean it now or another 10 years from now, I don't care, but I won't be revisiting it by sending him a friend request at any point.\n",

      "Last week, Ted Cruz announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate, which was a masterpiece of cynicism that's going to fail quite spectacularly. Given that a pet rock should be able to beat Trump in any reasonable election, it's kind of amazing to see the Cruz campaign making such poor decisions — and it's surprising that the Republicans rallying around Lucifer incarnate (aka the Zodiac Killer) aren't offering him better campaign advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a lot of theories as to why the flailing campaign thinks Fiorina can resuscitate it, most obvious of which being that Fiorina is going to appeal to women voters, which is sexist, insulting, obnoxious, and reminiscent of Sarah Palin in 2008. Women are in fact smart people who don't actually vote solely on the basis of a candidate's gender, and the same people who didn't vote for Palin are likely the same people who aren't going to be casting votes for a ticket with Fiorina on it — because those people believe that issues trump gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of trumps, a woman on the ticket does, of course, mean that Donald Trump is going to find it difficult to resist saying something horrifically sexist — so some critics suggest that she's basically the sacrificial lamb, serving as Trump bait. It's a gross but not entirely unreasonable suggestion, predicated on the belief that people who are on the fence about Trump might vote for Cruz if The Orange One says something incredibly horrific about Fiorina, which he will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the thing, though: People are really underestimating the amount of misogyny on the right — Trump voters obviously don't care about misogyny or they would have stopped voting for him long ago — and they're also pointedly ignoring Fiorina's own misogyny. If adding her to the ticket was a transparent attempt at getting women behind Cruz, the campaign, and the GOP, has made a fatal mistake. Republican women choosing between Trump and Cruz might go for Lucifer incarnate over Trump, but it's honestly kind of a tough call. Trump is a misogynistic poop emoji, but so are Cruz and Fiorina.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout her time as a businesswoman, and as a politician (with multiple failed campaigns to her credit), Fiorina has repeatedly illustrated that she's incredibly misogynistic, and incredibly had for women. In a Cruz vs Hillary faceoff in November, which isn't going to happen, having Fiorina on the Republican ticket isn't going to siphon off Clinton voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina has repeatedly claimed that her candidacy makes it impossible to play the \"gender card,\" forcing \"identity politics\" out of the race and requiring Clinton engage with the actual issues. Notably, that's... what Clinton was already doing, and it's Fiorina who keeps bringing up gender, much like her male counterparts. Repeatedly attacking Clinton because she's a woman is misogynist, and refusing to discuss the issues that Clinton is engaging with in lieu of making snide comments about the \"woman card\" is also misogynist.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of her core arguments is that as a female candidate, she can magically make the \"war on women\" rhetoric from the left disappear. That's not actually how it works, because this issue isn't about the gender of the candidates, but the actual social and institutional policies that are harming women.\n",
      "\n",
      "These policies are implemented, supported, and propped up by people of all genders, including women — they are rooted in deep conservatism, often Christian conservatism specifically, and women are just as capable of hurting women as other people are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which...\n",
      "\n",
      "Carly Fiorina's life story, which she likes to trot out on the regular, is a classic bootstrapping narrative. She went from working as a secretary to being the CEO of a major corporation, which is an undeniably huge achievement for a woman in the United States. She also, of course, enjoyed considerable advantages along the way. She was white, she had a husband who supported her career, and while she has two stepchildren, her husband took a very active role in raising them, freeing her to focus on her professional development in a climate where women are repeatedly told that they cannot have it all (Fiorina opposes paid maternity leave, incidentally, because what's good for the goose evidently isn't good for the gander).\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's important to recognize Fiorina's accomplishments, it's equally important to discuss the fact that she faced fewer obstacles than many other women.\n",
      "\n",
      "That bootstrapping narrative and her own conservatism underlie many of her stances on social issues, starting with fair pay, which, yes, she opposes. While she admits that a gendered pay gap exists in the United States, she blames it on liberalism, believes that women have sufficient legal protections, doesn't acknowledge the racialized nature of the pay gap, and opposes minimum wage increases, which would improve quality of life for millions of women. Pay is a pretty fundamental issue for women in the United States, because poverty is a factor that prevents people from advancing their lives — it's worth noting that Fiorina comes from a rather privileged background.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also opposed the Affordable Care Act and has regressive attitudes about access to health care in general, especially when it comes to reproductive health services. Like many conservative women, she doesn't support access to contraceptives, and she's extremely anti-choice, identifying herself as \"pro-life\" and supporting restrictions on access to abortion. She even gangpressed unsuspecting children into serving as pawns for an anti-choice speech, in a particularly galling move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limiting access to any kind of health services hurts women, and hitting reproductive health care is a particularly low blow — certainly no Clinton supporter is likely to switch allegiances for a woman who thinks abortions over 20 weeks should be banned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, she's actively supported the sustained attacks on Planned Parenthood. She participated in the rhetoric surrounding the Planned Parenthood videos last year, taking pleasure in leveraging them for the anti-abortion cause. Additionally, Fiorina has outright lied about Clinton's stances on abortion, making lurid and suggestive remarks that amount to calling her a babykiller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina is quite conservative, which makes her appealing to a very right-trending Republican party, but ultimately, people need to make their own decisions about how they want to vote. Female Trump supporters certainly aren't going to magically switch allegiances, enticed from the fold by Fiorina. If anything, they're going to recognize the move as a cynical ploy to attract their votes, and it's going to repel them. Just as Trump likes to spew rhetoric about the \"woman card,\" so too will they reject a Cruz/Fiorina ticket in the primaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberals of all genders with concerns about social issues, including her misogynistic policy positions, aren't going to vote for her — in a general election, pretty much any Democrat is going to capture the majority of the liberal vote in the United States, and Fiorina on the Republican ticket isn't likely to woo voters away. If Cruz is hoping to package himself as more electable in the general by having a woman on the ticket, he just made a grave mistake.\n",

      "With those nine words, spoken to me by my best friend's husband, came the end of a more than decade-long friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "Millie* and I met our sophomore year of high school in science class. She was friends Pam*, my best pal at the time, and though I'd heard a lot about Millie, we had never been introduced. Our social Venn diagram had very little overlap. Now, we were sitting next to each other and it was her goal to make me laugh at least once every class. We gelled instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like so many other depressed, socially awkward kids in high school I rarely made new friends, so I prized what friendships I had as a triumph over adversity. I was artsy, introverted, and painfully self-conscious (I still am, but being thirty-something comes with better coping mechanisms). Millie was my polar opposite. She was bold and she took no bullshit from anyone. However, like me she had the inner pain of being an intelligent, poor kid born in Eastern Kentucky. It was our bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "After high school graduation, we both received scholarships to our hometown college. We moved into the dorms together and shared a two-person room for a year. We plastered memorabilia all over the walls, doubled our wardrobes by agreeing to borrow whatever, whenever, and Millie made paper names plaques for our separate sides of the room. She worked at a local movie rental place — these were the days of yore — and I worked at a national pizza chain that allowed its workers, mostly poor students, to bring home free food at the end of the night. We pulled off THE quintessential college set-up, but it only lasted a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our mutual friend, Pam, was dating a guy from high school, Nick*. Nick's older brother, Jack*, moved to our neck of the woods to escape the drug scene he had fallen into in his hometown out West. Jack was the self-destructive type and no stranger to the practice of self-medicating with whatever was available. However, he was affable and it was not unusual for all of us to do things together, like movie nights and dinner. You really couldn't help but like him; he was smart, unassuming, and witty. He was also a pretty broken individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millie and Jack began dating and, a few months later, she was pregnant with her first child. She was terrified at the prospect of motherhood before finishing her degree, but remained optimistic. She had always talked about wanting children in her future; the future just came a little earlier than she expected. I helped her out as much as I could, listened to her fears and her well-founded complaints about Jack not being supportive enough, and showed up at her work late at night to serve as a buffer against the creepier customers at the video store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millie gave birth to her first child, a son, with Jack nervously by her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affection and understanding were easy for Millie and that's probably why I came to her with my own pregnancy dilemma a few months later. It's hard to believe I showed up at her door almost 13 years ago, freshly purchased First Response test in hand, and needing support. We had spoken on the phone maybe thirty minutes earlier and she gently guided me through what I needed to do that afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I'm pregnant, Millie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's going to be okay. You don't know yet, so go get a test. Bring it to my house and we'll take it from there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so nervous, I couldn't even check the results. She went into the bathroom and checked it for me, confirmed my suspicions, then held me as I cried and cried. Unlike her, I never planned on children. I was shocked. She gave me her unwavering support because it was the hardest time in my life. I gave birth to my daughter nine months later. Millie and Pam showed up the next day to marvel over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed and we grew into our mid-twenties. I got divorced, gained sole custody of my daughter, and married the love of my life, Alan*. Millie and Jack got married and had another child, a daughter, but was apparent to anyone who talked to him that Jack didn't feel like he was up to the challenge. He was scared shitless by having people who depended on him emotionally and financially. Often he coped by drinking and smoking too much. I witnessed his self-destructive tendencies in real time over and over, but never to the extent of \"the night\" in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millie and Jack had returned from a prolonged family visit out West and we were now living in the same town. We made plans to have dinner and stay at their place overnight. Needless to say, I was very excited; I missed my friend and wanted to catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at their house in the afternoon. Hugs were given and drinks were poured. We picked up right where we left off, reverting to inside jokes and our friendship shorthand. Everyone seemed at ease. The night flew by quickly. Millie and Alan were fading, but Jack and I decided to smoke a cigarette before calling it a night. As a recovering addict, my resolve often lapsed once I was a little tipsy. I asked Jack if I could bum a smoke. He agreed and we made our way to their garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the harsh florescent lighting I noticed just how drunk he was. His face was pale, his eyes were baggy, and he stumbled a little. I took a cigarette from the pack he held out. A weird smirk crossed his face. We sat at a couple of folding chairs and I remembered how ridiculous smoking is. You're relegated to freezing your ass off in cold metal chairs while you suck toxic fumes into your lungs. It's stupid. We talked about their trip out West and how their family was adjusting to life after the move back. Then things took a bizarre turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel like I should try to kiss you.\" He mumbled it, but it was audible. Jack was comfortable saying it. Like he had tried the line a thousand times before on a thousand other women.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" I felt nauseous and I asked him to repeat himself. He did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goddammit!\" I was livid. \"I love my husband and I love your wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I ranted about how ashamed he should be, that it's a rat-bastard move to try that on anyone let alone YOUR WIFE'S BEST FRIEND WHILE SHE SLEEPS IN THE NEXT ROOM. Jack hung his head, blankly agreeing with everything I said. As I ranted he pulled a pill from his shirt pocket and swiftly chased it with a swig of straight liquor from his glass. I had no idea what he had taken. At that point, I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found my husband asleep, woke him, and spilled what happened. Being level-headed and stoic, he held me and told me how sorry he was that Jack pulled this bullshit. He said he would have a talk with him the next day, when Jack wasn't drunk. At the time, I secretly wished Alan had beaten him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the shock subsided, I realized the horror of the situation: I would have to tell Millie. I didn't know what would happen, but she deserved the truth. I would want to know and I believed she would, too. Jack had put me in the shittiest of positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Millie had to leave in the morning for a couple of hours to check in at her office. Alan took to opportunity to confront Jack outside. He told him in no uncertain terms to apologize to me and asked him what the hell he was trying to pull. Jack became submissive, asking my husband over and over again if he was going to punch him. To my husband's credit, he did not. Jack reluctantly apologized to me and begged me not to tell Millie what he had done. It was the most self-serving and insincere apology I've ever received. I would later find out from my husband he had to force it out of him. Cowards never want to face the repercussions of their actions, so I wasn't surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Millie came back home, Jack stayed glued to her so I couldn't get her alone to tell her what had happened. I took an opportunity and gestured to Millie to come into the garage with me. She did. I immediately started crying and the events of last night poured out of me. She stoically wept as she listened to me recount every last detail. There was no blaming me for what had happened. There was no anger directed at me. Over and over she said, \"This isn't your fault.\" It honestly was not what I expected. I anticipated screaming, yelling, and objects being hurled across the room. Nothing. This type of devastation had made her quiet. Everything ended in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have to go,\" she said. She coldly hugged me goodbye and I could tell we would be strangers from this point forward. I haven't seen or spoken to her since. I've attempted to contact her twice, through email and text, but have received no answer and I don't think that will change. I had no idea what I expected when I made my decision to tell her, I just knew she deserved the truth. In an strange way, I feel like telling her was worth the cost of our friendship. Maybe it was the catalyst for Jack to get therapy. Maybe she will eventually leave him and realize he's not worth it. I have no way of knowing. Of course I wish sharing the knowledge with her hadn't cost such a high price. Still, I don't blame her for never wanting to talk to me again. Any future meeting between us would be a terrible reminder. I sincerely hope her decision has given her peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn't a day I don't think about her and her children. I'm still in mourning and it's been five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "God, I miss my friend.\n",
      "http://www.xojane.com/relationships/my-best-friends-husband-hit-on-me\n",
      "Earlier this week, a longtime Jivamukti yoga teacher found herself at the center of a $1.6 million civil suit involving allegations of sexual harassment. Considering the intimate nature of yoga as a physical practice, that such charges have begun surfacing should come as no surprise. What is shocking is the response, or lack thereof. Yoga is a beacon for people in distress. Even if you don't hit the mat as a way to deal with trauma, body work can invoke buried memories. This lesson should have been learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a staple of many gyms and studios, you can't find an \"Anusara\" class these days, thanks to sexual harassment and financial impropriety findings in 2012 against its founder, John Friend. In 2013, the first of what would become six complaints was filed against the dean of hot yoga, Bikram Choundury; it was filed by his own attorney. Hot yoga abides, but you're less likely to see \"Bikram\" classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Jivamukti has come under fire, not because of its founders, but because of its teachers. First it was Dechen Thurman in 2014, alleged to have slept with many of his students. The response then was to question the motive of the person who made the accusations. Now comes a complaint against Ruth Lauer-Manenti, filed by a former student. In her suit, Holly Faurot claims that Jivamukti is more like a cult than a yoga school and uses yogic teachings to engender devotion, resulting in harassment and discrimination. The response has been to question Faurot's motives. Both teachers remain on the studio schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I ever entered Jivamukti's studio in New York City in 2007, I was a trained yoga teacher. The consistent excellence of their classes made me consider their training, but I didn't embrace their veganism platform so I merely practiced there. During my years at the studio, I witnessed plenty of calls for teacher worship, along with instructions for pooping, and requests to participate in animal advocacy. I marveled at the empire the founders had built by turning their not-so-mainstream ideals into a business. That distance did not mean my own practice had been trauma-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "I first went to yoga to get in shape. Unbeknownst to me, I was about to get a divorce. Many times I would weep in class. The uncontrollable sadness and yearning for a love that had disappeared was reminiscent of the loss of my first love, a man who'd drowned in his mother's swimming pool. Back then my response had been to bury the pain, which took me down a shame spiral of drugs and alcohol. I couldn't let that happen again, so I moved to India to study yoga and meditation. I didn't know if it would work, but I already knew my way hadn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the thing — I was 39, childless, and relatively debt-free. In other words, I was able to do something incredible in response to my trauma. I understand this opportunity was a grace I didn't deserve. But I didn't let that stop me from snatching up the chance that most don't get. As a result of the healing I experienced, I've happily encouraged other trauma survivors to practice yoga. Without having to leave home, I've seen thousands of students get better — emotionally, physically and mentally — through the practice of yoga postures. Even when, like me, they didn't start practicing in search of something more meaningful weight loss. To them I say, \"join us!\" Because I know the practice will work when they're ready if they need it. Unless, of course, their trauma is exploited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the plaintiff was exploited in this case is yet to be determined. In the court of public opinion, however, the damage is done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The response from Jivamukti founders astonishingly bad. In the sole reply I've come across to date, founders David Life and Sharon Gannon don't concede that there was a relationship between their teacher and the plaintiff, instead denying any wrongdoing. Then they go on to offer this: \"A person sees what they want to see... If a person is focused on money every thing they encounter is conditioned by that thought. If a person is thinking of sex they will see others around them in that light. If a person sees themselves as a victim they will see others around them as either victims or perpetrators.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To make such an emotionally tone-deaf response to these mounting condemnations is wrong on a human level, while also managing to miss common sense business practice. Look at the difference between what happened recently with morning TV stars Kelly Ripa as compared with Ann Curry. Both women were treated badly by their networks, but the \"Live with Kelly and Michael\" star and her network were very public throughout, whereas Curry and NBC became embroiled in blame and subterfuge. That didn't stop a book from coming out in 2013, describing the cutthroat politics of morning shows, nor did it stop ABC from overtaking NBC in the ratings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a sense, these are two separate issues. There is the cult of personality inherent in any self-improvement movement, be it religion, a cult, or yoga. Then there is the idea that the bigger a business gets, the more its mistakes will be made and felt. If a business is to survive, it needs to address its problems, not blame its victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that yoga attracts people in search of healing makes it all the more urgent to respond proactively. Sensitivity training should become a required component of teacher programs. As a yoga school, Jivamukti could lead the way. At the very least, Yoga Alliance should speak up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I (and I assume others, because I'm not affiliated with a big studio), have been encouraged to keep quiet in the interest of not feeding into sensationalism. Or not speaking badly about another person? Honestly, I'm not sure which. And I'm not interested in either. But after a season that included \"The People vs. OJ Simpson,\" which dredged up memories of how badly we treated Marcia Clark (and Hilary Clinton still), and the TV drama \"Confirmation,\" beyond the business aspect of this, I am personally invested. And I am personally responsible if I don't say something.\n",

If nothing else, yoga has taught me dedicate myself to listening to the wisdom within. The real shame would be to let bad publicity of a very few tarnish the opportunity for many.\n",

      "Last night, viral photos of Lil' Kim surfaced all over my newsfeed. Immediately, you notice something different about her — her skin is a few shades lighter. While she did not admit to bleaching her skin, a few hours after she posted her new selfies, she shared three throwback pictures in which her skin is slightly darker. Of course, along with viral photos comes an onslaught of backlash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lil' Kim is not the first celebrity to bleach her skin, and I'm honestly surprised there's so much controversy regarding her appearance. All my life, I've been exposed to bleaching products and whitening creams. The women in my family used them religiously. Whereas most Americans and westerners prefer having bronzed, tanned skin, many POC's beauty standards are held up to a whiter regard (no pun intended). Pale, white skin is what many Asians (in the Americas and in Asia) wish to covet, not our natural golden color. I know my Latina and Black female friends have felt the same way and are equally intrigued by how our culture and standards of beauty vary so differently from their culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my Black friends said she's so tired of seeing only light-skinned Black women in media, and it's time we got rid of this archaic beauty standard, and I agree. We only see certain types of women because the entertainment industry is heavily dominated by white, heterosexual cis men who have specific beauty standards in which they deem whom is beautiful and worthy of casting (i.e. Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone). I too rarely see darker-skinned Asian women portrayed in media. In regions such as the Philippines or Thailand, where women are naturally darker than the women in northern Asia (such as Japan or Korea), there's an even bigger pressure to be whiter, paler. To me, all the famous celebrities from Asia all share similar features — big doe eyes, slim oval face, and extremely pale skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandmother told me at an early age I should never play outside because if I got tan, no man would want to marry me. Growing up, I saw a thousand commercials of flawless, thin Asian women with unblemished white skin touting chicly packaged whitening creams (my family had a subscription to SinoVision, a leading Chinese television network). I always found it fascinating how my classmates in school would get compliments when they came back a shade darker from a weekend out frolicking in the sun because I was taught that was not beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In second grade, I went to Italy with my extended family and my aunt carried a parasol with her wherever she went. I remember my whole family getting stared at by Italians and tourists alike. Despite it being one of the hottest summers of my childhood, my aunt wore long sleeves and made sure she was always in the shade. At the time, I had no idea why it was such a big deal, but looking back now, I feel so naive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand where Lil' Kim is coming from. Michael Jackson felt the same way — alienated in his skin, not knowing where he fit in society, and he let his body dysmorphia rule his life. Lil' Kim has publicly spoken out about her insecurities as far back as sixteen years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All my life men have told me I wasn't pretty enough even the men I was dating. And I'd be like, \"well, why are you with me, then?' It's always been men putting me down just like my dad. To this day when someone says I'm cute, I can't see it. I don't see it no matter what anybody says.\" I only hope she gets the help she needs and can move on from this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her words break my heart because I know exactly where she's coming from. This notion of European beauty as the epitome of beautiful is outdated and needs to be replaced. Beauty comes in all shapes and forms, and no one has the right to dictate who is beautiful and who isn't. Young children, especially, need to be comfortable in their skin, otherwise they might feel insecure throughout the rest of their lives. Body dysmorphia affects 1% of the population, but we need to do all we can so that future generations don't feel this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the comments on various reports of Lil' Kim's new look is heartbreaking to me. Women, especially, have been the most critical of her appearance — from comparing her skin bleaching to that of Rachel Dolezal's (which is NOT the same) to saying they can longer support her because she's so blinded by her vanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lil' Kim, I'm so sorry you feel this way and I stand with you in solidarity, as do many in the POC community. We, at some point in our lives, have all felt the need to cater to European standards. Some may still feel that way, and are happier for it. Others have accepted that's not their beauty standard, and have moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution to this dilemma does not lie in belittling others and starting Internet feuds. We're perpetuating primitive beauty standards by shaming Lil' Kim because society has for so long convinced us what is beautiful and what is not, and it's about time we changed that.\n",

      "My pregnancy had already been pretty awful. Being 4'10\" and 95 pounds at the start, I ballooned all the way up to 179 pounds in the ten-and-a-half months that I was pregnant. It got to the point where I wasn't able to drive because my belly pressed into the steering wheel too close for comfort. I wasn't trusting Florida drivers to not rear-end me, that's for sure. My feet and ankles got so bad that it was hard to walk at all, and absolutely no shoes made for human feet would fit around my swollen cankles. My face erupted in an angry mass of acne after a lifetime of clear skin. I was a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all in all, I was happy to be carrying my very first baby girl. I couldn't wait to meet her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of my pregnancy, I knew I wanted to have my baby at home or in a birthing center. The idea of being in a cold hospital with strange hands guiding my baby into life was not one I wanted to entertain. I got information from friends, my insurance provider, and the birthing center I wanted to use. I was ready and empowered with my decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the 20-week ultrasounds were showing that the placenta was lying low, making the delivery more difficult and delicate than a traditional birth. Immediately, I knew what that translated to: hospital birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was devastated, but I was determined to meet the situation with an open heart and mind. All birth plans can't go exactly as written, and I thought the most important thing to do would be to just go with it. I saw it as preparation for how important it is to stay flexible in parenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of my pregnancy was spent trying to stay off of WebMD and everything else that would feed into my fear. I wasn't afraid of giving birth; I was afraid of everything that comes with being in a hospital: needles and injections and pressure to do things a specific way. I wanted to bring my baby girl into the world with the love and energy intended by my new family. I'd binge-watch The Office over and over, cringing at the episode where Cece is born and that awful nurse rolls her eyes at Pam for asking her to not bottle-feed her new baby to avoid nipple confusion. That kind of attitude was exactly what I didn't want at a time where I was already unsure and nervous, like any new mom is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week 40 arrived. That's not uncommon, my doctor assured me. Most babies don't come at their due date. But when week 41 came, she wanted me to go to the hospital for an induction. Something inside was screaming at me from the beginning to turn around, and when the nurse gave me the option to leave and not go through with the induction that day, I gladly took it and went home for a few more days. That was a Tuesday, and they told me to be back on Friday if I wasn't in labor already.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Friday morning, my boyfriend and I grabbed our birthing bag, our doctor's notes, and our plans, and we went to the hospital to meet our baby girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the very beginning, I was uncomfortable, but tried to be cooperative and honest and open with all of the medical professionals with whom I came into contact. I let them know I was nervous and already had a fear of hospitals and a history of sexual trauma; I wanted them to know that I needed them to be open with me and let me know everything they were doing and what I should do to help things be as comfortable for me as possible. To be perfectly honest, it's hard enough letting my boyfriend be around me down there. To have a whole slew of people I don't know and have never seen before just lurking around by my vagina scares me to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first woman I met that would be \"caring\" for me was a midwife named Susie*, a squat little woman with chubby fingers and a grimace on her face. Her apprentice was a soft-spoken, taller girl with a lip ring and long dreadlocks twisted into a top knot. The first thing Susie did was look me up and down, look at my chart, and say, \"You know, you didn't need to gain so much weight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked that a woman who chose to go into this profession would make such a condescending comment (especially when she really didn't have a leg to stand on in this department).\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first touches were firm but not necessarily rough. She instructed as she went, telling the apprentice what she was doing as she placed the medicine behind my cervix to help along the process of induction. Susie told me not to move; she would be back to check on me in 12 hours. So I sat in bed for 12 hours, hooked up to more machines than I thought necessary for giving birth. How did we get by before modern medicine? How do people in places where these things don't exist continue to populate the area? These are the thoughts that kept running through my mind while I pined for something real to eat and watched the edited version of Mean Girls three times on the hospital television.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve hours later, my anxiety was starting to get the better of me. The medicine had done nothing to further the labor. I was bloated with saline from IVs and hungry from not being allowed to really eat. Susie was clearly off her game, as she had forgotten to order the second round of medication and set back the process by another two hours. Frustrated and already exhausted, I laid back and prepared myself for the second round of medicine to be placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susie decided to let the apprentice give it a try this time, and I did my best to stay still and relaxed as she made three attempts to try to place the medicine behind my cervix. Susie finally told the apprentice to move and took the medicine from the apprentice to place herself instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forcefully, Susie shoved her fingers inside me to her knuckles, and my body began to tense up from the discomfort. I don't know if the show of force was supposed to be a way of telling the apprentice that this wasn't a difficult task or if she was trying to tell me that I was to blame for the fumbles, but the shock and pain caused me to cry out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, she forced her fingers as far inside me as she could fit and, gritting her teeth, grumbled, \"Suck it up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The world stopped. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I can hardly remember anything that happened between that moment and her turning her back to me to remove the glove and wash her hands. I was in complete shock. I looked around me; I was in a room full of people. My sister, my boyfriend, a nurse, the apprentice — none of them would look me in the eye. My mouth hung open in horror at what just happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was absolutely inappropriate,\" I managed to say to Susie's back as she reached for napkins to dry her hands. I looked around wildly, hoping that someone would come to my aid, that someone would echo my disbelief at her unprofessional and insensitive behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susie turned to me in a rage, raising her voice about how I was being uncooperative from the start and was \"clearly not trying to have this child today.\" I was shaking as she came closer to me, her face only a foot away from mine as she leaned over the bed. I reminded her that she was rude to me before I'd ever said a word to her — that the first thing she had mentioned was my weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she couldn't help that I was \"too fat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I bitterly spat back at her, \"I'm pregnant. What's your excuse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not proud of that weak moment, but I wanted her to hurt even a fraction of the amount she had inflicted on me in such a vulnerable moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told Susie to leave immediately. I explicitly told her and the nurse and the apprentice that she was not going to touch me again, that she would not be in my room, that if she was the only midwife available that I would transfer to another hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susie left, but still no one told me that I was OK. No one told me that what she did was not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the induction is a blur. That interaction with Susie was early Saturday morning around 5 a.m. A combination of the shock and the pain medications put me into a state of delirium. I mostly slept. The next thing I knew, it was Sunday night. I had a fever and was now considered a high-risk pregnancy. It was around 11 p.m. that my new nurse checked to see how far I was dilated, and confirmed what was my worst fear through my whole pregnancy: we were having a C-section.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 42 weeks exactly, we were wheeled into the operating room to meet my baby girl. I rested my forehead against my boyfriend's while I was strapped to a T-shaped table, and I sang to him \"I've Just Seen a Face\" by the Beatles to keep myself calm while I felt the dull sensation of the surgeon moving around my insides and removing the beautiful creature I had housed inside my body for the better part of a year. It was 12:45 a.m. on Monday morning, and finally, the moment that made everything worth it was here. She was here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only an hour or so later, maybe, and the nurses were noticing that I was bleeding too much. The surgeon came back into my room, took one look at me, and I was immediately swept back into the operating room. It was like one of those scenes on television, with a flurry of nurses and doctors saying \"stat\" and the patient looking up at the white hospital lights, wondering if that is the last thing they're ever going to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I calmly asked the doctor at my side, \"Am I going to be OK?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor looked me right in the eyes and said, \"I don't know. You're hemorrhaging. We may have to give you a hysterectomy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I just nodded back at him — or at least I thought I did — and tried my best to keep my heart rate as steady as possible. An angel appeared at my side in the form of an anesthesiologist, who stopped everyone from working on me before he could make me comfortable and sent me to a medically induced sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was woke up in the same recovery room, I saw my boyfriend cross the room to meet me. He told me I lost a lot of blood from retained placenta in my uterus. I had been given four blood transfusions. We were all lucky I made it out of surgery alive, he said. I just nodded back at him, looking around for my new baby. She was all I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even being in the hospital for two more days and all of the scares that came after my interaction with Susie, it is that moment that sticks out to me most. When I look back on my memories of bringing my daughter into the world, I won't have something triumphant and sweet to show my daughter; I won't have the breathtaking photos of the natural water birth we wanted. I won't have a beautiful birth story to share.\n",

      "By Emily Flitter and Luciana LopezNEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton scored sweeping victories in nominating contests in their home state of New York, and immediately cited those wins to argue that they are all but unstoppable as their respective parties’ presidential nominees.Trump’s crushing defeat of Ted Cruz in Tuesday’s primary election tilted the energy in the Republican race back to the front-runner, just as Republican National Committee members begin meeting in Florida on Wednesday to discuss their July convention, where the nominee will be chosen.For the Democratic favorite, Clinton’s more narrow victory over Bernie Sanders snapped a string of victories by the 74-year-old democratic socialist and gave her a much-needed lift with more tough fights ahead.The eventual victors of the Democratic and the Republican nominating campaigns will face each other in November’s general election.Trump’s win, celebrated to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” at Trump Tower in Manhattan, marked a rebound from his Wisconsin defeat two weeks ago. It set him up for another big night on April 26, when Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland will hold primaries.With a campaign staff reboot and a more focused performance, Trump has sought to improve in recent weeks as a candidate. The tone of his victory speech was in keeping with a more measured style the often-brash billionaire has adopted.“We don’t have much of a race anymore based on what I’m seeing on television,” Trump said as television networks projected a large margin of victory for him. “Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated.”Trump, 69, predicted some “amazing weeks” ahead for his campaign.Still, he has a long way to go to seal the nomination and begin trying to heal the wounds in his bitterly divided party. Some fence-mending may happen when he sends campaign advisers to the RNC meeting starting in Hollywood, Florida, on Wednesday.Trump’s haul of most of New York’s 95 delegates moved him closer to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination outright. Anything short of that will lead to a contested convention when Republicans hold their national conclave July 18-21 in Cleveland.“There’s only two issues left for Republicans: Will Trump get 50 percent of the delegates prior to Cleveland, and if not, how close will he be? New York gives him a nice boost, but it will take weeks before we know the answer,” said Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas, came in third in New York and gave his primary night speech in Philadelphia, where he was already focused on running in Pennsylvania. He called on Republicans to unite around his candidacy.Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, a long-shot candidate, is seeking to use his second-place showing in New York as proof he is emerging as Trump’s central challenger in the states that come up next on the calendar.NO KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR CLINTONClinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, former secretary of state and former first lady, got nowhere near the knockout punch she needed to finally put Sanders away.But the broad smile on her face as she gave her victory speech spoke volumes about how important New York was to her bid to become the first female U.S. president.“Today you proved once again there’s no place like home,” Clinton said. “This one was personal.”The race for the Democratic nomination, she said, is now in “the home stretch, and victory is in sight.”Clinton, 68, was to campaign in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Sanders flew home to Vermont to take a day off the campaign trail.Clinton’s win made it nearly impossible for Sanders to overtake her commanding lead in delegates needed to win the nomination.Dilawar Syed, a tech entrepreneur who is also the co-founder and vice chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, a Super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian-American voters, said it looked like Clinton has the nomination.“Clearly Senator Sanders has a lot of supporters and enthusiasm there. He also has raised a lot of good resources,“ Syed said. \"I think the primary will go on for some time. But just looking at the numbers, we know where this is going.”Sanders’ campaign vowed to fight on until the Democrats’ nominating convention in Philadelphia July 25-28.“Look, we’re going to go to the convention,“ Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told MSNBC. He said it was extremely unlikely that either candidate would have the delegates needed to win the nomination outright.Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Clinton has a delicate balancing act in trying to draw in Sanders supporters while pivoting to a general election matchup against the Republican nominee.“She runs a risk. If she goes too far to the left (to draw in Sanders supporters), she’s going to upset independents and others that she’s going to need in the general,” Manley said.Nationally, the race for the nominations has tightened recently for both parties, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday.Clinton and Sanders are tied among Democrats, with each drawing about 47 percent support in the national poll. At the beginning of the year, Clinton led Sanders by nearly a 2-to-1 margin; Sanders has closed that gap over the past few months.Among Republicans, Trump leads with 44 percent support, compared with 33 percent for Cruz and 16 percent for Kasich.The April 15-19 poll surveyed 719 Democrats and 593 Republicans. It has a credibility interval of 4.7 percentage points.(Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Megan Casella in Washington, Jonathan Allen in New York and Emily Stephenson in Philadelphia; Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n",
