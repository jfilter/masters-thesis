By the end it could not be denied. Now I'm sure it helps that I'm a musician, since this created an immediate connection to the subject matter. I spent a portion of the movie with my Telecaster in my lap trying to play along with the characters who all seem to be really playing and singing these songs. However I also am *not* a fan of country western, so that could have easily been a turn off.  \\n\\nTo begin describing the action in the film is daunting. I can't even process a lot of what I saw. This movie is extremely dense, and the first 30 minutes or so are spent just trying to figure out who people are. Their relationships to one another - some of which are purely incidental - slowly become clear as things progress. It's an ensemble cast with no clear lead and lots of overlapping conversations. Some developments all tie together in the end. Some seem to be kind of loose ends. There is throughout, however, a very keen sense about people. These naturalistic performances are believable and so is the world they inhabit. It feels like a film that doesn't exaggerate - rather, it downplays some of the outrageousness which just makes it seem all the more outrageous. Consider for example Shelley Duvall's wig or Jeff Goldblum's entire character.  \\n\\nI feel I should mention this. Jeff Goldblum is in this film. He never speaks, and he is awesome.  \\n\\n*Nashville* is a musical. There is reportedly around an hour of music in its 150+ minute run time. I believe it. Sometimes these songs, most if not all of which are original, seem to speak pointedly to or about a character. Sometimes it's all about the shifts and glances in the audience. There are many memorable scenes, such as when a fragile country starlet spaces out on stage and begins rambling between numbers, or a disenchanted housewife waits at the back of a bar for a womanizing folk singer, or a poor deceived waitress is goaded into a striptease by a raucous crowd and still refuses to believe that she can't actually sing.   \\n\\nThis is rich film, a complex tapestry perfectly suited to a moment in time (the US Bicentennial) that seems as though it will reward additional viewings. I sometimes become fidgety during long movies but I was never bored with *Nashville*. It swept me along with its quirky and interesting characters to a climax that maybe I should have seen coming.  \\n\\n8/10\",\n",

       "  'body': '**January 16th 3 Sets:** \\nWent out shopping with my grandma as I visited her. We go to a Factory store. Opened 3 sets.\\n\\n* First Set: was the changing room gal, HB 6 cute asian gal. Asked her a lot of questions about what i was wearing. Made her laugh several times with corny jokes, introduced her to my grandma, and we all talked for a minute after I was done picking out the clothes I wanted and left. \\n\\n* Second set: was this older gal, mid 40\\'s. Wouldn\\'t give her an HB because it was more of just a casual chat about the outfit I put on. She said she didn\\'t like it, I responded with \"aw, I\\'m not attractive?!\" and she said \"I never said that haha\" and grinned. I gave her a wink as she continued laughing and went into her stall.\\n\\n* Third set:  **NUMBER CLOSE** As me and my Grandma are waiting in line to be helped checking out, and HB7 walks to the register and helps us. We IMMEDIATELY small talk. Exchanging intellectual talking points such as martyrs and assassinations, making her laugh with jokes, poking fun at her, transitioned to talking about movies, and she suggested I watch one. The Darjeeling Limited, I gave her a queer look, she then rolled out some receipt to write it down. I asked her to put her name down there too. She did, and then said \"Want my number so you can tell me when you watch it?\" I obliged her saying \"Yeah, that could work\". It was only after I got her number she even ACKNOWLEDGED my grandmother being ONE FOOT next to me the whole time! HAHA. She asked who she was, I said my Grandmother. Mind you I look completely white, and my grandmother is full Japanese. We talked for a bit about my grandma and the war, and how my grandma was bombed etc. Then I take my leave and text her about an hour later. We have been talking since.\\n\\nTL;DR: Got a number with my Grandma right next to me!',\n",

Before ordering since no line was behind me I decided to small talk with the Female at the register HB5. Mostly talked about sports, a little about myself, and her coworker HB6 joined in the conversation. This lasted about 5 minutes, learned both had boyfriends through small talk and proceeded to order.\\n\\n* 5th set: Also small talked with the female who works at my local grocery chain. She was new there, we talked about the rain of all things haha. Male coworker semi interrupted us, still small talked with both.

It is in pretty good shape with a few blemishes here and there but nothing major. I assume the gun as seen some range time since the previous owner used it as his side arm. I have a guy who wants to trade me his Kimber Pro Carry II for my Defender. His seems to be pretty much brand new. I'd like to hear some opinions as to whether or not I should make the trade. Neither gun will be an everyday carry so I'm not concerned with the difference in barrel length. I'm more curious if going from a Colt to a Kimber would be a bad move?

       "  'body': '\"Going from a Colt to a Kimber is a bad move.\" Well... Kinda. I wouldn\\'t call it a BAD move as much as \"a good move for the other guy\". I\\'m not on the Kimber bashing bandwagon, but I do understand why there is such a bandwagon. Without trying to sound like a jerk about it, I don\\'t think a Kimber is quite the 1911 the Colt is, either in quality or reputation. Kimbers can be fine 1911\\'s, but Colt is known as the standard by which others are measured. That being said,  Kimber is under that standard the same as an Ed Brown or Doug Turnbull is above it (although not by the same amount). Hope this helps and doesn\\'t come off as dickish. In short, you\\'d be doing the other guy a favor and not yourself. \\n\\nEdit: I forgot to mention something else. Get a photo of that Colt posted!',\n",

I guess my real reason for asking is because I know the other guy's Kimber is almost mint and mine has quite a bit or range time. I don't know much about the longevity of these guns. Just assumed maybe newer would be better??? Also, here are pictures of both guns. Mine: http://imgur.com/6KQIvzY And his: http://imgur.com/L0PdiD7\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Lawl I seriously hate this argument. Probably nobody will see this outside of you but I don't care, here it goes:\\n\\nPeople say slayer is more efficient for melee than just training for xp or farming something for money because it's decent at both. The problem is, the casual player is better off not slaying past a certain level if they only want to maximize exp and monetary gains.\\n\\nSlayer brings in good gp over time but it is inconsistent in the short term. The profitable tasks outside of the slayer item drops (whip, dboots, dbow) can be done with or without slayer. It takes an extremely long time to exceed 80 slayer, likely over 125 hours of play. That is ballpark two or three months for any non hardcore player that ONLY does slayer. Additionally, this time could be better spent doing other activities.\\n\\nWith the update of NMZ, training combat stats is no longer like using dh at monkeys in ape atoll or killing thousands of yaks. It is extremely fast exp and often times brings a decent profit. Because of the ability to always keep piety on and target low def monsters, the xp/hour rates shoot through the roof and are always much much higher than slayer (outside of one or two tasks, probably dags come within 15k per hour). Purchasing herb boxes easily takes care of the cost of prayer potions used during the activity. With the time saved from doing combat stats, players can use their spare time to focus fiercely on making money.\\n\\nMaking money through combat stats is not very difficult once the stats exceed 80+ (which doesn't take long using nmz). There are a range of options including, but not limited to: gwd, barrows, dks, colored dragons. All of these options double the gp/hour average of slayer at worst and at best offer drops exceeding 50M. \\n\\nAll in all, I will concede if you want to max out on osrs, this is not even an argument. Slayer is certainly the way to go for that. However, considering only 2 players are maxed in osrs speaks to the difficulty and dedication required to do so. Such dedication that many players don't really have anymore, largely because we're an older player base with more responsibilities than our 13 year old selves. Because of this fact, I vehemently oppose telling everyone who wants to get exp and money as fast as possible to slay because factually speaking it is not the way to go. \",\n",

They also added a new kind of agility course known as Rooftop courses, the advantage to training this way is that you earn tokens (they appear along the course for you to gather as you are doing obstacles) which can be traded for a weight reduction set of clothing. They also added a bunch of stuff to slayer. Added elite clues and tons of new rewards a few days ago. Those are the things that come to mind for me, there's definitely a bunch of other things I'm forgetting though.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Hey guys, I'm relatively new to OSRS members (I primarily played f2p rs2) and the member content is really awesome so far, really enjoying most of the skills, minigames, and areas opened up to me. Since bonds exist now, I'm trying to save up money so I can keep buying bonds to upkeep my membership. \\n\\nMy friend told me barrows is good money, so I spammed it a lot, and while I can kill it pretty reliably now it feels like I'm not getting a good number of runs per inventory; I can only get 5-6 trips in before I'm out of food or prayer, doing 14 kill count per chest. My friend said I should be getting 8 trips per inventory with my character's combat skill levels. Here are [my stats](http://i.imgur.com/1tqwpkC.png) and [the setup](http://i.imgur.com/RdFBvaB.png) I've been running. \\n\\nWhat should I change to do barrows more efficiently? Are there specific tricks to killing the brothers that I don't know about, which allows all the people to stay so long without banking?\\n\\nA lot of the barrows guides I found on the internet said to use items such as the Abyssal Whip, Saradomin Godsword, Toxic Blowpipe, or full Guthan the Infested's set, and while I would love to have them, my bank and melee stats sadly aren't there yet. Are they 100% necessary to barrow efficiently? If so, should I grind out my melee stats and gold until I can obtain and use them? \\n\\nThanks in advance for everyone's time, I'd greatly appreciate any tips you veterans could give me. \",\n",

At my current levels even if I bring super attack/strength potions, I have a really hard time getting 14 kc quickly with d scim because the max hit is less than my msb and I attack slower while hitting more 0s.\\n\\nI tried the safespot method by spamming doors before, and while it's a bit safer than hoping ice blitz doesn't splash, it was something like 1 chest every 10-12 minutes instead of 1 chest every 6 mins, plus I randomly get hit a 10 by skeletons while spamming the doors. I still had to burn 1 prayer dose on Ahrim and Karil either way so I figured it wasn't worth the time loss. \",\n",

In a very large group all it takes is 2 Ruby specs to sit you at the top as meleers may find it hard to hit 200 damage in the time it's alive, then again, unless you hit a ruby spec, you're basically not going to hit anything. Melee will most likely get you the kill more often, but in a mass where you're going up against multiple maxed people in maxed gear it all comes down to RNG, regardless of which style you choose.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Apologies in advance for the long post, just trying to include as much relevant info as I can.\\n\\nBasically, I'm trying to hook my PS3 up to my LCD monitor, but I'm encountering some very strange issues. The monitor is an HP S2031. When I got the PS3 about a year ago, I tried to connect it to the monitor through an HDMI cable. The monitor doesn't have an HDMI port, so I just used an HDMI-to-DVI adapter and used that to connect the console. However, when I turned on the monitor, it would always just show a blank screen.\\n\\nI finally found a solution by just fiddling around with other electronics in my apartment. I had a Hyperkin VGA box for hooking up my PS2 and original XBox to a big old CRT monitor. It converts composite video input to VGA output. Now, I connected the PS3 to the VGA box through composite video, then connected the box to the CRT monitor through VGA. Then I simultaneously connected the PS3 to the LCD through the HDMI cable (via the DVI adapter). With this setup, the LCD monitor suddenly recognized the PS3 and I was able to use it.\\n\\nSo, two questions:\\n1) How the hell did this setup work? I have no idea why connecting the PS3 to both monitors fixed the problem, nor do I know how I was even able to come up with the idea in the first place.\\n\\n2) Does anyone have any thoughts on why I couldn't just connect the PS3 to the LCD monitor? I no longer have the CRT monitor, so I can't use that system anymore. Can anyone help me figure this out?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n[](/unresolved)\",\n",

       "  'body': \"This is just my guess, but by adding the VGA converter, the PS3 could only use one compression algorithm, thereby forcing it to use analog on both the composite and hdmi. DVI supports both analog and digital signals, and uses different pins for both. As such, when you force it to use analog, you're forcing the DVI connection to use different pins.\\n\\nIt's possible your DVI adapter has some bad digital pins, but the analog pins are fine. Perhaps trying the adapter with other digital devices or picking up a new adapter might be my first troubleshooting recommendation.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Good on you for finding a hobby. Find a couple. They will enrich your life.\\n\\nHere are some ideas:\\n\\nCooking - no matter how well you think you can cook, you can always improve. It\\'s a lifetime hobby. Watch some videos, geek out on something specific. I\\'m geeking out on eggs. When I started eggs 5 years ago, I thought, \"how hard can it be to master an egg?\" Truth is, I\\'m still learning about \\'em. Bonus is that this hobby will save you money and make you healthier (vs. eating out).\\n\\nPoker - find a nice weekly game with serious players but without serious money. Then read about the game and work on improving. If you find the right group you\\'ll end up swapping money around week over week. Any one week shouldn\\'t cost more then $40. A free alternative is Bridge, which I don\\'t play, but a few friends say it\\'s a great game.\\n\\nLearn an instrument - you can buy a nice Uke for $300 or a nice acoustic guitar for $500. Tons of free online resources to help you learn.\\n\\nGardening - I used to hate this. But the more I do it, the more I\\'m learning. And now it\\'s become a hobby.\\n\\nWood Carving - you can get a good set of chisels for $50 and wood is cheap. Fun pastime, although I never got good at it.\\n\\nArt - Learn how to sketch, paint, etc. Cheap entry point, tons of free online resources.\\n\\nHiking - as others have mentioned, it\\'s free, healthy, and it clears the mind. I didn\\'t see the original purpose of it, so I did geocaching to give me a \"goal\". But now I enjoy the walk itself.',\n",

I take my pan off the fire 20 seconds before they are done and finish cooking with the residual heat in the pan.\\n\\nNo need to add milk or water.\\n\\nSalt at the end.\\n\\nCreme freche mixed with scrambled is a whole new level.\\n\\nPre-heat meats and some vegetables before adding to an omelet.\\n\\nOh, and there is a very fine line between a scrambled egg and an omelet. They are far more similar than how I used to approach them.\\n\\nI\\'m sure I\\'ll get folks disagreeing with the above. But they\\'re **my** eggs and I\\'ll make \\'em how I like.\\n\\nAnyway, I know you\\'re kidding, but the egg was just an example of something culinarly mundane that, when approached as a mini-hobby, I found much more enjoyable than just cooking the same-old egg.

       "  'body': 'Hi Slow Carbers! I\\'m a newbie to the slow carb diet, I just started last Sunday. However, I did try Keto for a month or so in October, but it was impossible for me to sustain because the cab counting and precise macros required drove me crazy to the point of obsessiveness. Also, the idea of an all-out cheat day appealed greatly, so I decided to give this a try.\\n\\nNow, as this is my first week, I have not yet had a cheat day - I chose Saturday which is tomorrow. However, I just found out today that I have an unavoidable social obligation on Tuesday, where slow carb food will be next to impossible to find and alcohol will be almost obligatory. I am known in my social circles as a great lover of food, especially dessert, and a great drinker, so any abstinence from either will raise a whole lot of questions that I really don\\'t want to deal with. \\n\\nDo you recommend I shift my cheat day to Tuesday for a week? Food, I can probably manage. But abstaining from alcohol in this situation will be impossible. \\n\\nSTATS: 20/F/5\\'2\"/SW:105lb\\n(I am quite small, I just have a large amount of bodyfat around my belly which I am hoping to lose.)',\n",

Evan is a really good Tank I think he is 2nd to Rudy but I may be wrong. Maybe not as good as 36 Rudy but still very good.\\n\\nIn order to get a 36 Rudy through log in tickets you need to play 112 days. At the end of it you will have pulled the 4th Rudy needed to make him 36. You will only have 1 7k tho which is also your tank. (not nec a bad thing). If you go the Evan route you will have a 36 7k  say Jave or elleen and lvl 40 evan to tank. I know a lot of it is also the team around your tanks but i really think the trade off isnt that bad considering the power having high level other 7k could bring.  \\n\\nIf Even didnt evan come close to Rudy i could understand but imo he does a great job as a tank. That stun is great. im sure his stats are lower but his passive is only 10% less than Rudy's and his awakening heals allies as well. Its like comparing a metre thick steel wall to a metre thick iron wall. One is stronger than the other but punch either and see how far you get\\n\\n\",\n",

If the measurements indicate your size is around 42DD, the bra you just got for Christmas might be the wrong shape for you. Do the wires fully circle your breast tissue? Are the wires sitting in your inframammary fold (the place where the bottom of your breast meets your stomach)? Does the gore (the middle section between the cups) touch your sternum? These are common signs of fit to look out for in a wired bra.\\n\\nIf 42DD ends up being the size you measure as and you want some wireless options, here's a bunch: http://www.barenecessities.com/42DD-Wire-Free-Bras-Bras_catalog_nxs,31,size,1038,style,65.htm?cmp=xyz I'd guess that the ones by Bali and Playtex are probably available in most department stores, and the Anita and Goddess ones can likely be found at Nordstrom or Dillard's. \",\n",

This is still a pretty expensive bra though! It's a mostly cotton bra and very comfortable, though the fabric when new is a bit stiff--it needs a couple of washes. Note that they don't have a DD cup--the bra is EU sized and it looks like their equivalent to a DD is E cup.\\n\\nIf you have access to Royce lingerie, they make beautiful wirefree stuff, but the prices are not cheap! It's a British company (so UK cup sizes, but at a DD cup I think UK and US still correspond to each other). I think they have a US site and they are stocked at some specialty stores in the US and elsewhere. If you can get a size in their Grace style, it's a lovely bra. Beware their bra-size calculator, though, as they appear to use the infamous +4 sizing method. \\n\\nEdit: Actually, when I think about it, you can probably find a decent range of styles and brands in wirefree bras in your size at large department stores. Bali, Playtex, and Goddess are all good bets, as is the Just My Size line by Hanes if you can find it. Any of those make good bras that are more economical than the Anita and Royce bras.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"I hope i'm not too late responding and i hope my comment gets read. \\nI experience exactly the same. I can explain this by naming everything incoming 'signals'. Birds whistling, cars driving by or a sheet of paper falling from my desk. All signals. For me, all signals have equivalent importance when they enter my brains. I have no pre-selection in those; noticing an airplane flying over is as much as important as the work in front of me on my desk. Therefore, i get easily distracted by the things that ARE from lower importance but are not sorted out this way. When i try to concentrate on my work (which could be anything), the following counts: the less signals, the better. When playing **loud** music, a shitton of signals are already canceled due to the fact i cannot notice them. Basically the only signal beside my work, is the music, which isn't a sudden signal and therefore easier to deal with. The benefit of handeling one signal in contrary of, let's say, 10 signals has always been so fucking rewarding. \\nHopefully my response was clear and understandable, if you have any questions don't bother asking me. \",\n",

       "  'body': '1. What are your dreams and aspiration.\\nI have so many dreams!! I made a bucket list a few years ago: https://www.facebook.com/ChrisAcrosstheWorld/photos/a.10150132728766628.327966.263109691627/10150257380341628/?type=3&theater One of my goals is to open an orphanage. I never had a family, so I can relate to kids who don’t. I want to give them a plavery country. For Chris Across Africa, I want to gather donations from people and visit every country in Africce to go. That is really important to me. However, I don’t know much about how to run an orphanage yet. So I will study! I would like to film a Chris Across Africa video, but I want to make this one different. In all my other videos, I am just flipping across the most famous landmarks in ea, and donate money to orphanages along the way. Maybe, instead of doing acrobatic tricks in every country, I would like to film the kids there. Maybe teach 1 kid in every country how to do a backflip and about the importance of a strong mind and body. I don’t know yet, but something like that. Along the way, I hope I can stay at the orphanages and learn how they work. However, I do not have enough of a following to generate the amount of cash I would like to donate. I really want to make a BIG impact. As big as I can!! So I need to get more people interested!! I think I will film Chris Across Asia next. Then, I would like to find someone who might marry me…It gets kinda lonely traveling alone so much. I’d really like to film a “Across Europe” video with them. After I get married, I will spend as long as needed to make their dreams come true. Then hopefully, I will be able to start my Africa project. This was a lot more detailed of an answer than you probably want…sorry…haha, I am passionate about dreams :)\\n\\n2. What do you think is the perfect way to live life?\\nI think maybe everyone is different. We all have different paths, and different “perfect ways”. But I think it is very important for everyone to have balance in their lives. Balance social activities with private time. Physical work with mental work. I always like to live life thinking what can I do to make the world a better place. For me, personally, this is a really good lifestyle.\\n\\n3. What would you like to accomplish before taking your last breath?\\nPlease see the answer to #1. Haha...my dreams~ I would like to accomplish my dreams, and the dreams of my future partner (whoever they are ^^). \\n\\n4. What makes life so worth living?\\nLife is so much fun for me!! I really like it! It’s tough! Challenging...sometimes unbearable, but I really do love it! For every tough time I have had in my life, I have had 10 times that amount in blessings I didn’t deserve. I have felt lonely before. It is a terrible feeling. I hope that I can make others feel less lonely. If I can do that with even just 1 person, then I will feel my life was worth it. \\n\\nI really liked your questions! Thank you!! I would love to hear your answers to the same questions! What do you think? ',\n",

We all know what it’s like to spend 5 hrs taming and have it killed by somebody else riding it without permission!!!!!!!  \\n\\nWe train people!!!! In this game there is no tutorial!!!! Trial and error is rough man!!! We share knowledge and answer any questions without griping about it.   \\n\\nWe want New players!!!!! There is nothing like rediscovering this game EVERYDAY!!!!!!!!!!  \\n\\nThe worst feeling I have encountered is getting disconnected from the server while riding my favorite dino in hostile territory!!!!! HATE IT. Anyways we will immediately dispatch a team to retrieve your dino and your body…….or what’s left haha. Seriously it’s a huge deal to lose a favorite dino.\\n\\nIf your out in the wild and you are taming something for yourself or the tribe we will air-lift you supplies, other players and high level dino’s for support. There is nothing like being 2 hrs into a 4hr tame and having it killed by some minor dino or lack of narcotics!!! \\uf04c \\n\\nWe have community resources!!!!! I despise trying to craft an item and finding out I am missing two pieces of metal etc. no problem walk out of my house and into the supply room…..BAM!!!! the resource is right there! Super-convenient.  \\n\\nWe are allied with several other tribes on our server. Basically if there is a rare item that you want you have trade partners, same with dino’s. if we get raided they have our backs, need 20 flyers to mine resources…. bam!! We got it. Always somebody on to talk to etc. \\n\\nOur base is Ridiculous!!!! Awesome defenses, they get better everyday. We are positioned on the coast so it’s very hard to get lost, also you can get where you need to go quickly. Massive dino pen. And it’s not just long…. It’s also vertical!!! sooo cool.   \\n\\nI am sure I am forgetting things, however you can message me\\n\\n\\nGT MalusDarkblade5\\n\\n\\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out.

I'm a single player only person and found the default 1x gathering, xp, and taming to be horribly slow for a casual player like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found a happy spot with the taming and I think 2 gathering is good for me but the xp is something I struggle with. I have it at 10x right now and that seems very fast for my level 15 dude. I went up two levels after crafting a cooking station... I'm thinking this might only feel too fast because I'm quite low level and as I get into the 30s, the 10x xp multiplier would feel ok? \\r\\n\\r\\nHave any of you settled on something that works really well or do you start with a low multiplier and raise it as you level up and start to feel like it's a grind? I'm not so much into grinding, I'd like to explore and build neat stuff but I also don't want to possibly miss out on a fundamental aspect of the game which feels like it's xp gathering as well.\",\n",

You certainly get the hour requirement to be licensed, but that has no impact on your ability to sit for the exam. The masters is set up for people who either 1) didn't do accounting as an undergrad, thus don't have enough upper level hours, 2) graduated undergrad with not enough credit hours to sit. 3) want to have a Masters on the resume. \\n\\nThe way Texas schools do it is essentially a 5 year program where you get your masters at the end as well. So you don't have to overload your undergrad with classes just to make it. You have to weigh it personally. At some point you have to pay for it, either through undergrad classes or through Masters program which is only 1 year. \",\n",

Maybe big 4 it matters, but OP did not mention that or where he lives for that matter.\\n\\nYeah well you definitely need to pay for it I just don't think the ROI from a Master's warrants the inflated price tag.\\n\\nAnyways I think we did this thread justice. \",\n",

Use a simple T account to figure out what the entry should be.  There will be times where you actually reduce the allowance and associated expense.\\n\\n3.  I don't understand the question, but you almost never record an adjusting entry to cash.  My guess is that the entry they are asking for is to record the interest.  This would be a debit to Notes or Interest Receivable and a credit to interest income.\\n\\n4.  Debit Cash, Credit AR.  In a separate entry you will recalculate what the allowance should be at the period end.  The entry will be a bit more complex if you already wrote off the receivable (debit allowance, credit AR).\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Just finished my intro to financial accounting course; let's see if I remember any of it:\\n\\n1) Yeah, but just keep in mind that it's a method of cost allocation and a non-cash expense.  Dunno if you've gone over cash flows yet, but it's important to add it back to cash flows from operations since it actually doesn't decrease cash on hand.\\n\\n2) No.  The allowance account carries into successive periods.  I guess this is most important for when you use the aging of accounts receivable method to determine bad debt expense, as the expense will be the difference between whatever final balance you determined with the aging of accounts receivable and the current balance in the account.\\n\\n3) Two entries.  Debt cash and credit NOTES receivable (accounts receivable is more for cash that customers owe to us).  Then, because there's 13% annual interest on the note, you need to find the total money you'll receive as interest revenue as well (which I think is just 15600 x .13 x 6/12).  Debit cash, credit interest revenue.\\n\\n4) If you write-off an amount but find out later that a customer does pay for it, just reverse the write-off entry.  Debit A/R gross and credit the allowance for doubtful accounts; no expense account gets affected.  That's sort of the whole reason we make the initial BDE / allowance entry in the first place.\\n\\nHope that's all right.  I'm sure the veterans here can correct me if I'm mistaken.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Tonsil stones are the fucking nastiest shit ever. If you don\\'t know what they are then you\\'re lucky as hell. If you want to go vomit, just Google \"tonsil stones\" - they\\'re disgusting smelly nasty clumps of bacteria and \"calcified material\" that accumulate in your tonsils. Think throat boogers that smell like rotten milk.\\n\\nThey\\'re so damn gross and I\\'ve had them all my life. My tonsils are really deep and hard to get in to, so it can be days or weeks until I realize I\\'ve had tonsil stones make my mouth smell rancid all this time.\\n\\nTrying to clean them out is painful and makes my throat hurt. It involves gagging and heaving and drooling over the sink. Like just now I tried cleaning out bunches of tiny tonsil stones in my tonsils that looked like maggot eggs. I can barely get them out, some actually just got pushed back into my tonsil and made it bleed. **Fucking nasty.** So now my throat hurts and I have nasty little tonsil stones somewhere deep in the crevices of my tonsils. \\n\\nMy boyfriend gets them too, but his tonsils aren\\'t super deep or hidden under flaps like mine are so he gets them out easily.\\n\\nI\\'ve been thinking of removing my tonsils altogether because that\\'s the only way to completely get rid of them forever, but my boyfriend says it\\'s bad for you to remove them because \"they\\'re your body\\'s first line of defense\" or something. :l Well they\\'re fucking disgusting and useless to me if they make me feel disgusting and make my mouth smell like I\\'ve been gargling moldy eggnog.  \\nI don\\'t think insurance will cover getting my tonsils removed, so that\\'s another issue.\\n\\nHas anyone gotten their tonsils removed *as an adult* and could share their experience?

       "  'body': \"I just had my first tonsil stones ever yesterday, I thought they were last night's dinner (rice), but i touched one and and smelled it, and I swear to god it smelled like poop. Just poop. Like straight up poop. I was terrified, I've never had it happen before. I've been sick with a terrible cold the last week, and my tonsils (which are usually tiny) are like the size of balloons right now. So I'm figuring this is happening now because I'm sick (I hope it never happens again).\\n\\nAnyways, I looked it up because I was freaking out and found out it's super common. I read a bunch of remedies, but also corrective surgeries. They mention getting your tonsils resurfaced by laser, it smoothes them out so there's no wrinkles or pockets for the stones to form in. I would do that before getting tonsil surgery. My dad is a doctor, and he said in medical school, the only surgery that ever made him squeamish was tonsil surgery. He said the knife is close to one of your major arteries (I can't remember which one, I did not follow in his doctor footsteps), he could see it pulsing, and it would only take a millimeter of a mistake to cut that baby open (he's also blind in one eye, and has no depth perception, so clearly surgery was something he only observed and never performed, and maybe that's why this freaked him out so much). Anyways, long story short, remove your tonsils as a last resort, try the laser resurfacing.\",\n",

Hell, I\\'ve been having an ear infection for like a year now that I keep putting off going for, because like tonsil stones, it\\'s an annoying inconvenience that pops up every day but doesn\\'t kill me or cause me serious pain. I should probably go and get my ears checked out. (I\\'ve been saying this for months, never happens.)\\n\\n> Also, Google \"how to prevent tonsil stones\".\\n\\nlol. Saying that like I haven\\'t done that a bunch of times already. It\\'s usually things like gargling with salt water, pushing them out with Q-tips, and eating/drinking less dairy.  \\nI don\\'t each much dairy - I drink hot water or hot herbal teas a majority of the day and have a cup of coffee with cream once a day maximum.  \\nPushing them out with Q-tips means I already have them and need to get rid of them, and I\\'m trying to prevent them from happening in the first place.  \\nGargling with warm salt water doesn\\'t seem like it does anything to stop the formation of the stones. It does calm my throat if I hurt it by trying to get them out though. Maybe if I do a salt water rinse daily it would help prevent them.   \\n\\nI just read something on /r/tonsilstones which is to get a syringe and squirt warm water in the tonsils which is something I haven\\'t tried yet, so I\\'m going to try that.\\n\\nI also just searched \"tonsils removed\" on Reddit and now I\\'m thoroughly horrified by looking at pictures and reading stories of people swallowing giant scabs and I think I\\'m going to hold off on removing my tonsils... Ew.  \\nSo, I guess I\\'ll be trying a daily salt water rinse to see if it helps, along with the syringe method. ',\n",

He has multiple game systems and hand held systems and his own computer.  \\n\\nFor example he said he didn't have money for the gym. But he tried to buy a $700 graphics card for his computer the next day.  And my gym is only $15 a month.  What should I do? \",\n",

I've worked for the company about a year longer than him and have basically seen no reward for my hard work, and I get more work done and a higher level work done than anyone in my department. \\n\\nHe got transferred to a new department where he will be getting paid more than me and also get to travel on the company dime. All the while I'm stuck in the same department where I get no recognition for any of the work I do and work for a conniving boss who takes credit for my work. So, obviously, I'm a bit jealous of his move to a new department.\\n\\nOn top of all of this, my university is playing in a sweet sixteen game in the NCAA tournament and I would kill to go to it. I'm a huge basketball fan and this is huge for them. Since he is now in this new section of the company he got offered by the CEO a ticket to the game. Now obviously I am outrageously jealous and pissed off about the unfairness of the situation. My boyfriend didn't even go to the university. We were originally planning on trying to go with each other but he didn't want to spend the money. Now that he is getting to go for free he wants to go and doesn't get why I'm upset. \\n\\nSo really I'm just looking for some advice on how to overcome this jealousy I'm feeling and not resent him for these extra bonuses he is getting from our company. As much as I want to be happy for him it is incredibly difficult when the situation is so unfair.\\n\\nI love him so so so so so much. More than anyone I've ever dated. We are perfect for each other in almost every way. And I don't want this to ruin our relationship.

He may be thinking about you two in the long term, making sure you both have the best possible financial situation. Not that that totally justifies his decision, but it's probably what he's thinking about.\\n\\nOn your end, let me talk as one sports fan to another. I'm a huge 49ers fan. A few years ago when they went to the Super Bowl, I was on cloud 9. There was no way I would be able to go to the game no matter how much I wanted to. Instead of despairing, I reminded myself that as huge as this game is, there will be other football games, Super Bowl or not. So, it shouldn't matter *where* I am when the game is happening. I'll be just as excited as would be with 50 yard line seats, front row.\\n\\nAs for your job, take a good look at why you do your job. You have to do it because you love the job whether you make yourself love it or naturally love it. If neither of those are an option, then that's not a job you need to have. Your jealous thoughts source from some sort of fear. Get down to the root of that and deal with it directly.\",\n",

Opened 3 sets.\\n\\n* First Set: was the changing room gal, HB 6 cute asian gal. Asked her a lot of questions about what i was wearing. Made her laugh several times with corny jokes, introduced her to my grandma, and we all talked for a minute after I was done picking out the clothes I wanted and left. \\n\\n* Second set: was this older gal, mid 40's. Wouldn't give her an HB because it was more of just a casual chat about the outfit I put on. She said she didn't like it, I responded with \"aw, I'm not attractive?!\" and she said \"I never said that haha\" and grinned. I gave her a wink as she continued laughing and went into her stall.\\n\\n* Third set:  **NUMBER CLOSE** As me and my Grandma are waiting in line to be helped checking out, and HB7 walks to the register and helps us.

Just good old fashioned chit chatting.\\n\\n* 4th set: During the 49ers and Giants game I went to grab a bite to eat at the local burger joint. Before ordering since no line was behind me I decided to small talk with the Female at the register HB5. Mostly talked about sports, a little about myself, and her coworker HB6 joined in the conversation. This lasted about 5 minutes, learned both had boyfriends through small talk and proceeded to order.\\n\\n* 5th set: Also small talked with the female who works at my local grocery chain. She was new there, we talked about the rain of all things haha. Male coworker semi interrupted us, still small talked with both. Then ordered my drink.\\n\\nBlahhh, I know there's more than this...Hence why I should try to update every day. Be back soon guys.</td>\n",

I would give it a go. This is also my first Altman film so I didn't really know what to expect, except that people always compare PTA's Boogie Nights and Magnolia as being influenced by Altman.

I'm a good looking, 23 year old male, have had modest success in the past with women, but have decided that modest just isn't good enough anymore.\\n\\nThe problem has never been a lack of attention, or opportunity. It's just been not having the killer instinct and extreme AA, to the point where women will basically EYE FUCK me, and I still don't have the testicular fortitude to say anything unless they say something first.\\n\\nMy goal is to approach 100 sets by the end of April, and hopefully break my AA.   \n",

Opened 3 sets.\\n\\n* First Set: was the changing room gal, HB 6 cute asian gal. Asked her a lot of questions about what i was wearing. Made her laugh several times with corny jokes, introduced her to my grandma, and we all talked for a minute after I was done picking out the clothes I wanted and left. \\n\\n* Second set: was this older gal, mid 40's. Wouldn't give her an HB because it was more of just a casual chat about the outfit I put on. She said she didn't like it, I responded with \"aw, I'm not attractive?!\" and she said \"I never said that haha\" and grinned. I gave her a wink as she continued laughing and went into her stall.\\n\\n* Third set:  **NUMBER CLOSE** As me and my Grandma are waiting in line to be helped checking out, and HB7 walks to the register and helps us.

Let me see what I can remember\\n\\n**January 17-23 Sets:** Various sets I remember opening, unfortunately no number closes. Just good old fashioned chit chatting.\\n\\n* 4th set: During the 49ers and Giants game I went to grab a bite to eat at the local burger joint. Before ordering since no line was behind me I decided to small talk with the Female at the register HB5. Mostly talked about sports, a little about myself, and her coworker HB6 joined in the conversation. This lasted about 5 minutes, learned both had boyfriends through small talk and proceeded to order.\\n\\n* 5th set: Also small talked with the female who works at my local grocery chain. She was new there, we talked about the rain of all things haha. Male coworker semi interrupted us, still small talked with both. Then ordered my drink.\\n\\nBlahhh, I know there's more than this...Hence why I should try to update every day. Be back soon guys.   \n",

I love both making and eating it, so I'm sad to see that they usually have the most crazy calorie counts, and I don't see many low cal recipes for them especially not ones that can work for many different people (for instance, I see a lot that require sugar free Jell-O, cool whip, Neufchatel cream cheese, very specific items that aren't available everywhere).\\n\\n[So here is a reciped I made!](http://imgur.com/a/z6VbS) it's very delicious, and I hope others will enjoy it too :)   \n",

I used sugar-free raspberry Jell-O and pre-made mini graham cracker crusts.  They came out entirely too Jell-O-like in texture, but still tasty, and I'll be tweaking them and trying again.

I see posts about gelatine from r/keto on the front page, so I was under the impression that was easily available too? And digestive cookies, I know y'all have them! :b but that's the easiest thing to replace in this recipe,  didn't even use them myself   \n",

Typically here we use graham crackers in their place, but it's not exactly the same.

If you are above this primitive dialectics of his, move on to more serious writers. \\nZizek's aim is not logic, but compilation of the most recognisable terms into a sellable product. You must be very careful if you seek logic in what he writes. You will find it dismembered and without relation to any real meaning.

Amour in this subreddit and you'll find fitchecks showing the other bra. \\n\\nYou can also compare the two at bratabase. \\n\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-padded-pm-1500/\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-underwired-non-padded-pm-1502/\\n\\nIn addition I think the PourMoi? Amour sits too low just like the CK Elegance.

I had the same issue the other day with an sdhc in my card reader that doesn't work. I ended up [using my Wii with homebrew](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2uea6t/what_kind_of_electronic_life_hacks_have_you/co7m67d) to transfer the data. Either get a new reader (get one that is sdhc capable for your higher memory needs) or if you have a homebrew enabled Wii you can try doing something similar to what I did.   \n",

That's one cup size larger than 30E, so it's no wonder the pour moi doesn't fit. It may fit in 30E, I can't really say, or 32DD, but I believe it is too big for you here.\\n\\nI also agree with what ButTheBoobies says about the elegance. Can't really make a call on whether it fits or not just yet!    \n",

Amour is available in two versions, one padded plunge (which is recommended for shallow shapes, PM-1500) and an unpadded balcony bra (which you got, PM-1502). \\n\\nSearch for PourMoi? Amour in this subreddit and you'll find fitchecks showing the other bra. \\n\\nYou can also compare the two at bratabase. \\n\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-padded-pm-1500/\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-underwired-non-padded-pm-1502/\\n\\nIn addition I think the PourMoi? Amour sits too low just like the CK Elegance. You might want to try this bra again with the wires probably in the inframammary fold. \\n\\nButTheBoobies already covered the rest. \\n\\nBTW, since you got the unpadded now, could you please enter it into bratabase before you send it back?

The recommendations /u/Goddess_Keira gave sound pretty good, I hope you can find some you like! You don't have to worry about the gore tacking in a wire-free bra, as they aren't designed to do that, but the other signs of good fit will still be important to look out for.   \n",

I never had a family, so I can relate to kids who don’t. I want to give them a plavery country. For Chris Across Africa, I want to gather donations from people and visit every country in Africce to go. That is really important to me. However, I don’t know much about how to run an orphanage yet. So I will study! I would like to film a Chris Across Africa video, but I want to make this one different. In all my other videos, I am just flipping across the most famous landmarks in ea, and donate money to orphanages along the way. Maybe, instead of doing acrobatic tricks in every country, I would like to film the kids there. Maybe teach 1 kid in every country how to do a backflip and about the importance of a strong mind a...   \n",

We have a massive base and need more MANPOWER. I myself recently joined and i'm having a blast, learning alot too!!!

I am in a similar situation with my sister and I feel I could tell her things that are beneficial to her but she wasn't really listening. I like Bulldog931's advice about the random walks and talks, If you build your relationship with him he may want to do things with you more. If he's into shooter video games maybe set up some laser tag or paint balling together. Anyways I really just wanted to send some acknowledgement your way about you being a good sibling. Your love, concern, and being by his side is definitely beneficial even if he doesn't know it yet. I hope for the best for you both!   \n",

I've only played with my brother, but he always names Character... but that leaves plenty of other great things to grab.\\n\\nAs afishisborn mentioned, it does compete for a similar role with Support of the People. I'm using both in my deck right now (which is probably overkill, but I'm testing things out). I'd say Support of the People is great in the earlier game (although harder to trigger), but by mid or late game you've probably already gotten most of your locations out, so Olenna's Cunning > Support of the People as time goes on.\\n\\nI'd call it a x2 in Fealty/No Agenda... I don't have much (any) experience with bannering, so I can't speak for that - though I imagine it could be nice to grab a Treachery if you banner Lion.   \n",

(I think).  At any rate some flowers are on stems; others are on the end of fruit.  See [this photo](http://blogs.denverpost.com/preserved/files/2009/07/female-and-male-zuc-flowers.jpg) for an example.  You can pick off either and go to town.  The ones on stems won't turn into fruit; taking the flower off the fruit won't hurt the fruit - just let the flower(s) get big enough to make sure you're not picking off fruit with it.  \\n\\nZucchini flowers are delicious; have fun!   \n",

In fact, I often leave the gamepad in another room so that it doesn't even turn on.  As /u/longjohndevine said, you won't be able to change settings, and using Amazon Instant Video (as one example) isn't possible with just the pro controller.  Also, you should know that some games allow the use of the pro controller but require the gamepad in certain instances (SM3DW).  That can be a bit frustrating.\\n\\nStill, from time to time there are some really good deals on the Wii U.  You would not only get the gamepad, but you'd get a new console with a warranty.  You might consider keeping your eyes open and watching for posted deals here in /r/wiiu.   \n",

       "113928  Have an upvote for New Zealand! u/squone has nicely set out the basics for what you'll need.\\r\\rJust so you know, all the HERE apps work perfectly in NZ. I use them in Wellington, where I live, all the time. The Transit app is great if you ever need to use public transport and I know it works in Auckland too. Apparently it's not so great in Christchurch, but apparently that's due to the infrastructure issues following the earthquake.\\r\\rI would also really consider switching networks too. I changed from Telecom on an $89/m contract plan to the 2degrees $19/m 500mb prepaid plan, with a $99 12GB data add-on that lasts up to six months, upon the suggestion of a fellow NZ WP Redditor. Windows Phone works fantastically if you can indulge yourself and simply not worry about your data use. Xbox Music streaming, SkyDrive sync, having Skype always on and available - it just works great.\\r\\rAgain, I'd strongly suggest you switch to 2degrees.

About indes specifically, it's described and defined many, many times, so I don't think you can make the case that the texts are trying to intentionally be obscure about how indes is used.\\n\\n>We rely on subsequent interpretation by the masters of his lineage to infer the nuances of his artform.\\n\\nThis is actually **one** approach to interpretation, but not one that everyone subscribes to.

While you could think this doesn't matter, as Blizzard would get th 20$ for the token/gold either way, I think keeping players to fill the world (of warcraft) is extremely important, as many players are still playing mainly because of the people they play with. \\n   \n",

That's one cup size larger than 30E, so it's no wonder the pour moi doesn't fit. It may fit in 30E, I can't really say, or 32DD, but I believe it is too big for you here.\\n\\nI also agree with what xx_user_1 says about the elegance.

Amour is available in two versions, one padded plunge (which is recommended for shallow shapes, PM-1500) and an unpadded balcony bra (which you got, PM-1502). \\n\\nSearch for PourMoi? Amour in this subreddit and you'll find fitchecks showing the other bra. \\n\\nYou can also compare the two at bratabase. \\n\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-padded-pm-1500/\\nhttp://www.bratabase.com/browse/pour-moi/amour-underwired-non-padded-pm-1502/\\n\\nIn addition I think the PourMoi? Amour sits too low just like the CK Elegance. You might want to try this bra again with the wires probably in the inframammary fold. \\n\\nxx_user_1 already covered the rest. \\n\\nBTW, since you got the unpadded now, could you please enter it into bratabase before you send it back?

I never had a family, so I can relate to kids who don’t. I want to give them a plavery country. For Chris Across Africa, I want to gather donations from people and visit every country in Africce to go. That is really important to me. However, I don’t know much about how to run an orphanage yet. So I will study! I would like to film a Chris Across Africa video, but I want to make this one different. In all my other videos, I am just flipping across the most famous landmarks in ea, and donate money to orphanages along the way. Maybe, instead of doing acrobatic tricks in every country, I would like to film the kids there. Maybe teach 1 kid in every country how to do a backflip and about the importance of a strong mind and body. I...  \n",

I am in a similar situation with my sister and I feel I could tell her things that are beneficial to her but she wasn't really listening. I like xx_user_1's advice about the random walks and talks, If you build your relationship with him he may want to do things with you more. If he's into shooter video games maybe set up some laser tag or paint balling together. Anyways I really just wanted to send some acknowledgement your way about you being a good sibling. Your love, concern, and being by his side is definitely beneficial even if he doesn't know it yet. I hope for the best for you both!  \n",

I've only played with my brother, but he always names Character... but that leaves plenty of other great things to grab.\\n\\nAs xx_user_9 mentioned, it does compete for a similar role with Support of the People. I'm using both in my deck right now (which is probably overkill, but I'm testing things out). I'd say Support of the People is great in the earlier game (although harder to trigger), but by mid or late game you've probably already gotten most of your locations out, so Olenna's Cunning > Support of the People as time goes on.\\n\\nI'd call it a x2 in Fealty/No Agenda... I don't have much (any) experience with bannering, so I can't speak for that - though I imagine it could be nice to grab a Treachery if you banner Lion.  \n",

(I think).  At any rate some flowers are on stems; others are on the end of fruit.  See [this photo](http://blogs.denverpost.com/preserved/files/2009/07/female-and-male-zuc-flowers.jpg) for an example.  You can pick off either and go to town.  The ones on stems won't turn into fruit; taking the flower off the fruit won't hurt the fruit - just let the flower(s) get big enough to make sure you're not picking off fruit with it.  \\n\\nZucchini flowers are delicious; have fun!  \n",

In fact, I often leave the gamepad in another room so that it doesn't even turn on.  As /u/xx_user_0 said, you won't be able to change settings, and using Amazon Instant Video (as one example) isn't possible with just the pro controller.  Also, you should know that some games allow the use of the pro controller but require the gamepad in certain instances (SM3DW).  That can be a bit frustrating.\\n\\nStill, from time to time there are some really good deals on the Wii U.  You would not only get the gamepad, but you'd get a new console with a warranty.  You might consider keeping your eyes open and watching for posted deals here in /r/wiiu.  \n",

Apparently it's not so great in Christchurch, but apparently that's due to the infrastructure issues following the earthquake.\\r\\rI would also really consider switching networks too. I changed from Telecom on an $89/m contract plan to the 2degrees $19/m 500mb prepaid plan, with a $99 12GB data add-on that lasts up to six months, upon the suggestion of a fellow NZ WP Redditor. Windows Phone works fantastically if you can indulge yourself and simply not worry about your data use.

While you could think this doesn't matter, as Blizzard would get th 20$ for the token/gold either way, I think keeping players to fill the world (of warcraft) is extremely important, as many players are still playing mainly because of the people they play with. \\n  \n",

       "\"xx_thread_end  xx_comment_start DTX000: #00 - Nashville xx_sep 0/0/00 0/00/00 <URL> xx_linebreak It was only a few minutes into Robert Altman's homespun epic *Nashville* that I got the feeling I was watching a great movie. By the end it could not be denied. Now I'm sure it helps that I'm a musician, since this created an immediate connection to the subject matter. I spent a portion of the movie with my Telecaster in my lap trying to play along with the characters who all seem to be really playing and singing these songs. However I also am *not* a fan of country western, so that could have easily been a turn off. To begin describing the action in the film is daunting. I can't even process a lot of what I saw. This movie is extremely dense, and the first 00 minutes or so are spent just trying to figure out who people are. Their relationships to one another - some of which are purely incidental - slowly become clear as things progress. It's an ensemble cast with no clear lead and lots of overlapping xx_sep xx_selfpost xx_sep2 xx_user_0 xx_sep2 100movies365days xx_comment_end  xx_comment_start I've wanted to watch this for a long time. I was also turned off by the country western aspect. xx_sep2 xx_user_1 xx_sep2 100movies365days xx_comment_end  xx_comment_start You strike me as the type who would appreciate it. I would give it a go. This is also my first Altman film so I didn't really know what to expect, except that people always compare PTA's Boogie Nights and Magnolia as being influenced by Altman. Magnolia is probably the best analog in terms of structure (having no lead character) but it is stylistically very different, much more melodramatic and transparently earnest. xx_sep2 xx_user_0 xx_sep2 100movies365days xx_comment_end  xx_comment_start Yeah, I've always heard that Altman was famous for his ensemble casts. But I, too, have never seen an Altman. xx_sep2 xx_user_1 xx_sep2 100movies365days xx_comment_end  xx_thread_end\""
