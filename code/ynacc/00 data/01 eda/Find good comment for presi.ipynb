That does not in any way excuses the behavior.  Children are not good decision makers, they do not have the mental capacity yet to fully understand.  Studies have shown that.  Around 25 or so the brains is more fully developed.  That is why they are considered to be minors and protected under the law until 18.  They cannot consent to sex (though yes many do).   They also cannot sign legally binding contracts.  Should you sell your car to a 17 year old and the 17 year old signs the contract, then the kid drives away and totals the car, they can walk back to you and demand (and receive) a full refund and tell you to go get the car.  The contract is not valid.  In this case, the teacher in question is charged with violating the law.  Whether or not he had previously had sex (being a virgin is meaningless) is irrelevant.  Whether or not any boy in his position would do it is irrelevant.   Under the law it is considered rape.  Then there is the position that because of her position of authority (teacher) she also applied undue influence in the situation.

I\\'ve read the bible a couple of times and found it full of contradictions and quite frankly, quite boring, but I read it to give \\'faith\\' a chance. Zip. In conversations I\\'ve had with \"faithful\" people, you always bring up something along the lines of \"who created all this?\"or in your case \"Can you please explain, using only empirical evidence, how the first cell arose from non-living matter?\" Which is just saying the same thing. My response is, why do you believe that some supernatural being MUST have created everything that exists? We as scientists, don\\'t have all the answers but someday we may. Religion is what people resort to when they don\\'t have an answer but desire one greatly. As a scientist, I know better than to dream up supernatural beings or events to explain something we don\\'t yet understand. The faithful also bring up \"there are no atheists in foxholes\", which is evidence of their lack of critical thinking. How do they know that? i served in Vietnam. Spent a lot of time in foxholes being shot at. Came close to death several times. I never found faith in a foxhole. \"there are no atheists in foxholes\" is a myth but seems to give the faithful hope that they can convert the non-faithful. \"The clearest evidence for the existence of God is found, however, in the person of Jesus Christ.\" - Only if you are a person of faith. There is no physical evidence supporting his existence. Everything in the new testament attributed to Christ is hearsay. Christ and his apostles, never wrote down a single scripture. It\\'s pretty easy to put words into the mouth of a person who is dead or never even existed. Theologians are in agreement that the gospels are best viewed as \"church advertising\". The one thing I\\'m pretty sure of is, you will never convince me to become faithful for I have no faith. I will never convince you to develop critical thinking skills, for you are more comfortable in your faith and lack the will to break your chains and see the beauty of the universe without your faith colored glasses. There is nothing wrong with being relgious as long as you came to that point in your life due to your own research. If your parents brought you up in your faith, then you were brainwashed and it will take enormous effort on your part, to develop critical thinking skills and cast off the chains of religion. Believe me, I know what I\\'m talking about. My family is deeply religious. I\\'m viewed as the spawn of the devil (another mythical creature).',\n",

Among his first acts, as president, was the closing of hundreds of pending DOJ indictments against U.S. mobsters and gangsters. Clinton engineered China’s entry into the WTO, granting them preferred trade partner status. His corporate backers started sending work to China, which now equals the loss of millions of American jobs. Bill Clinton and Andrew Cuomo pushed millions of additional loans on U.S. banks, under the CRA, thus supercharging the mortgage and housing collapse (houses are still being lost). Freddie and Fannie rolled these shaky mortgages into bonds, which quickly failed, collapsing that usually solid market, for the first time in history. This caused bank failures worldwide, because these bonds were among the most popular and stable investments bought up by these institutions. Clinton got the U.S. involved in Bosnia, where we had absolutely no national interests (what was up with that?). Bill Clinton had already restarted the Iraq War in 1993 and prosecuted it for the next seven years. You do remember his sending 23 Tomahawks to destroy a military HQ in the middle of the night, killing 8 innocent janitors and 1998's Desert Fox, a four day long missile and bombing attack against targets in Bagdad, leaving untold civilian casualties, don't you? Clinton even failed to defend the U.S. during the eight previous al-Qaida attacks on his watch. Slick Willy could not have given bin Laden any more encouragement to pull off 9/11 and sticking Bush with two wars.. Clinton’s ending of HUMINT (human spy) efforts in favor of electronic spying also left us unable to verify the rumors of coming problems and nearly blind to what was coming on 9/11. Clinton’s national debt rose from $4.411488 trillion (in 1993 - his first budget year) to $5.807468 trillion, during his last budget year. This is an actual deficit of $1.395 trillion, which he paid down from the Social Security Trust Fund. Adding insult to injury the taxable part of the Social Security benefit under Clinton rose from 15% to 85%, hurting seniors and the disabled, with an added tax burden. The claims of a surplus, leaving a zero deficit or even balancing the budget never happened under Bill Clinton, who, when his party controlled the House, pulled off the biggest theft of Social Security funds since LBJ. Bush was president, when Clinton's house of cards started to fall apart. Bush was able to nullify the short term effects of Clinton's Great depression, but by the time his final term was ending the long term effects of Clinton's incompetence were being felt. Barack 0bama showed little ability to control the economy, create jobs or grow business and instead waited for a natural recovery, which started to slowly happen in late 2014 and has not been fully realized yet.  According to Gallup, today's U-6 unemployment figures are 14.4% which is higher than at anytime under George W. Bush. We also, currently have fewer people working than under Bush, with over 94 million needing jobs.

It prompted me to then share my true story at a doctor\\'s office. For some this story made them smile while others had different experiences with the story. I was thinking to myself with the way things are today if I could bring just one smile to one other\\'s persons face then I will have had a good day. So here\\'s my \"true story\" with my doctor: I had to have been in my late 20\\'s early 30\\'s when after taking a shower I had noticed a growth coming out of my \"butt\". My wife and I are now probably married pretty close to 8 years, my baby (girl) is close to 7 years old. So I call my relatively new wife to the bathroom and ask her \"honey something is going on with my butt can you take a look?\" I get the wife look, as though ok what\\'s up with him this time look? Like are you joking where\\'s the joke going to come from this time look? Anyway I say no really there\\'s something going on. So she peeks and says no there\\'s nothing there I can see. I say come on baby please there\\'s something there please try again. She then say\\'s ok let\\'s go on into the bedroom and you laydown on the bed so I can get a better look. So we march off into the bedroom I laydown on the bed and all of a sudden she say\\'s \"oh my god what is that\"? I panic I say what? She say\\'s you have a growth coming out of there. I say I know can you tell anything? Just then my baby walks into the bedroom as all baby\\'s do and then she get\\'s into it as well. What\\'s that she asks? Mommy say\\'s nothing but you can tell from my wife\\'s voice that somethings up. She\\'s concerned not only a little but is somewhat shaken. Both of our imaginations run wild and race for clues as to what this might be. We call the doctor i\\'m fairly certain this was on a Saturday as I recall, in any event we speak to the receptionist. We tell the receptionist what the problem is and she sets an appointment to see the doctor for later that morning. I arrive at the doctors office for the scheduled appointment I say hello to the receptionist she asks who I am and then asks me to have a seat and fillout these forms she just handed to me. I fill out the forms hand them back to her and after about 10 minutes passing a nurse then shows up at the receptionists window and calls out my name. I show up at the window and the nurse asks me what I\\'m here for. I say I have this growth on my butt, she says what? She then says you\\'ll need to speak up, I say again I have this growth on my butt. Growth on your butt she says I say yes. Oh ok she says please have a seat, then smiles and says wait would you like a pillow to sit on? I say no i\\'ll just stand here if that\\'s ok? She says yes that\\'s ok. I stroll back through the receptionist area that\\'s filled with patients with different ailments and sorted problems. Suddenly I see by their looks it\\'s as though anything that\\'s wrong with them can\\'t be compared to what\\'s wrong with me. It\\'s as though I just signed my own death wish, and felt as though I should be smoking my last cigarrete before seeing the doctor. Those were the types of looks I was getting from the other patients in the receptionist area. Finally my name is called and I\\'m led to one of the waiting rooms and the doctor shows up. He asks again what my problem is and I again go through the explanation. He says ok let\\'s get you up on this table and let\\'s have a look. So I strip down hop onto the table and he takes a look. He says ok I see what the problem is he says it\\'s a hemorrhoid a hemorroid I say what\\'s that? He says I can go into great technical detail but he says in a nutshell it\\'s a wild vein that gets a little out of control. I say to him not cancer? He says no it\\'s a hemorrhoid and can easily be taken care of. I truly breath a sigh of relief and say ok how do we take care of it? He says normall what I\\'d do is tie a rubber band around it and after a few days the vein would die and simply drop off. I turn around and look at him (It\\'s important to point out here that this entire conversation with the doctor is taking place while i\\'m on all 4\\'s with my behind hanging in the air and my face down on the table). At any rate I turn and look at him after he gives the rubber band explanation I say to him you\\'re joking right? I then think into my own mind that i\\'ve just entered the capital of Quackism and the head quack is staring squarely into my behind and giving me this explanation. My fear has just returned and he sees how skeptical I am and say\\'s no, no really it\\'s true there\\'s nothing wrong with you. You don\\'t have cancer and truly it\\'s how I would normally treat what you have. He convinces me of what he\\'s saying is true and I say ok let\\'s do it. He says that\\'s how he would normally treat the problem I have however in my particular case a hemorrhoid that\\'s way to large to simply tie a rubberband on. He\\'s recommending surgery, surgery I say? He says yes surgery it\\'ll only take about 20 minutes can do it right here and you\\'ll be out of here. Oh my god I start thinking how bad is this going to be? We decide to go on with the surgery and get it over with. He calls in a nurse and I tell you folks now this nurse could double for Marilyn Monroe and here I am in the most uncompromising position possible. He tells the nurse to prepare him for surgery. She follows his instructions as I try to bury my head further into the table. She scury\\'s around gathering all sorts of things, needles (good grief the size of the needle), then knives, towels etc. Her and I do not exchange a word she\\'s very professional and i\\'m very embarrassed and pretending that i\\'m not there. The doctor reenters the room and gives me a shot to deaden pain. After about 10 minutes he comes back and asks how I am doing and then Beautiful Nurse walks in and they decide to procede with the surgery. He then says to Beautiful Nurse spread his cheeks a little more. That was the last thing I remember hearing as I sort of passed out right there on the table in a heep of sweat. I\\'m woken up by the nurse and doctor and the doctor gives me some instructions. He says to me that what I need to do is to take a sits bath in warm water with salt for about 30 minutes. You\\'ll also need to go buy some Kotex napkins so you can change the dressing every half hour. I say ok he also calls in a prescription for me to the local drugstore and I move on. I am so sore but I manage to get into my car, I\\'d say at this point that getting into the car was more like opening the driver door and falling in face first and then turning my body into a sitting position. I make my way to the drugstore to pickup the prescription, while there I ask the pharmacists (who also happens to be a woman) where the Kotek Napkins are. She say\\'s what kind do you need? I say are there different kind? And my education begins on Kotex Napkins. I find to my dissmay that there all sorts of Kotex Napkins ones with butterfly ties, ones without, ones that are heavy, medium, and lite. I panic my doctor didn\\'t tell me all these things now what do I do. So I tell the pharmacists what my problem is and she says ok what you need are these with the butterfly tabs. So I take a box of them and my prescription and head back to the car and onto my house. I get home and explain to the wife what we need to do for the next 48 hours. She say\\'s ok and asks about the Kotex and I explain to her what\\'s going on with them. I take a quick nap on the couch (more like I pass out on the couch) after a trying morning. When I wake up it\\'s time for my first sits bath in the warm saltwater and then time to change the bandage. So I do the sits thing and all is fine and going along well and then it\\'s time to grab the Kotex and head to my bedroom and other bathroom to put on the new Kotex. The wife asks as I make my way, she says honey do you need any help with the Kotex? And in my macho Al voice I say no honey this I can handle. So I procede to the 2nd bathroom close the door, open the box pull out the Kotex and immediately attach the Napkin to my behind. I walk out of the bathroom and my wife says how did it go? I say fine but I also say to her that I have a finer appreciation for her and her problems with her special time of the month. I also say to her that I can\\'t believe that you go through this with this Kotex pulling on your hairs all of the time. She says what? And I explain to her again what I just said. She said wait Al you really didn\\'t paste that napkin on your butt did you? I said yes how else is it supposed to go? She says oh my god you\\'re so stupid you have it on the wrong way. I say no way she say\\'s yes you have it on the wrong way. I say ok now what do I do. I have this thing pasted the wrong way to my behind and now we need to get it off. So I decide to make my way into the bahtroom and pull the darn thing off, and oh my god that hurt, I can\\'t believe the pain, tears flowing from my eyes I just can\\'t believe this is now happening to me. So I come out of the bathroom with pants half way down my ankles and the napkin still attached to my bottom. I say to my wife honey I need help!!!! She comes in and looks at what\\'s going on and I swear to you she starts laughing!!! But one of those wife\\'s laughs that goes from laughter to sympathy to I told you so laugh. So we decide that we need to remove the napkin but how. Brite idea one of us which one I don\\'t remember decides to get a pair of scissors and try cutting the napkin away. Hair by painful hair she starts snipping away until we finally remove the entire napkin from my painful bottom. Three weeks after this event I walk into the drugstore again and I find this guy standing in the isle looking dumb founded into the isle where the Kotex are being sold. I mutter under my breadth stay away from the butterflies!!!!',\n",

Why would I quit something I enjoy? Because big brother deems it unhealthy and uses social engineering methods and means to deny people the right to choose what they do in daily life. The people never gave the Government the authority to regulate our lives to such a degree as it now attempts to do today. A wealth of overlooked literature concerning the Nazi crusade against smoking provides a clear parallel to contemporary developments and an alarming warning that state restriction of personal habits is the precursor to dictatorship. Beginning in the early 1930\\'s, as part of the Nazi agenda for racial purity, Hitler spearheaded a national campaign to ban smoking in all public buildings, and denounced the practice as a betrayal of the fascist drive for bodily purity. \"Brother national socialist, do you know that our Führer is against smoking and think that every German is responsible to the whole people for all his deeds and emissions, and does not have the right to damage his body with drugs?\" stated one magazine. - The Nazis banned tobacco advertising and financed huge public relations campaigns to propagandize people into giving up smoking. - The Nazis banned smoking in government offices, civic transport, university campuses, rest homes, post offices, many restaurants and bars, hospital grounds and workplaces, and Hitler gave awards to associates who quit the habit. - A ban on smoking in private vehicles was called for. - The Nazi Reich Health Office warned that smoking caused impotence and produced posters depicting smoking as a dirty habit of Jews, Gypsies, blacks, intellectuals and Indians. - Nazi lobbyists lectured terrified children in schools on the horrors of racial impurity as a result of smoking. - The term \"passive smoking\" (Passivrauchen) was coined by the Nazi Anti-Tobacco League. Its author, Fritz Lickint, offered no supporting evidence to claim that smokers poisoned everyone around them, while also stating that drinking coffee caused cancer. - Hitler was an ardent vegetarian and did not smoke or drink after the age of 30, even accrediting the rise of fascism to his success in kicking the habit. He forbade anyone from smoking in a room he might enter. Fellow fascist leaders Mussolini, Napoleon and Franco also detested smoking. - The Nazi anti-smoking crusade was unleashed with the help of manufactured junk science on behalf of the medical and health establishment, one such example being that smoking caused \"spontaneous abortions\" in pregnant women. - Hitler attempted to price out smoking for Germans, levying huge taxes on cigarettes. - Despite the Nazi propaganda crusade against smoking, tobacco sales increased in Germany, leading some history professors to hypothesize that smoking was an act of cultural resistance against fascism, until the late 1930\\'s after smoking was banned in most public buildings and tobacco sales rapidly declined. Either the Nazis were benign really cared about everyone\\'s health or they used the specter of anti-smoking to exert massive control over people\\'s lives and scale back basic freedoms, getting a foot in the door for the political dictatorship that was to follow. Similarly today, either the same elite that advocate \"mass culling\" of the majority of the world\\'s population really do care about public health and well-being or they are using the excuse of the anti-smoking drive to condition us to accept state regulation over every aspect of our personal lives. It\\'s all about control, it\\'s all about letting you know who the bosses are. If the government can regulate personal habits and behavior, what\\'s next? If the state is so concerned about our good health as they would have you believe, why not use the latest scientific advancements to remove that nasty aggressive gene that causes so much unhappiness? Well, you\\'re causing those around you distress and harming their health so why not? Are your political opinions a mental illness? Are they harming society? Perhaps we should ban certain types of \"free\" speech that is offensive to others. You see where this is all heading - how long before our wall mounted personal x-ray body scanners are accompanied by special smoke detectors that inform on you to the local Stasi if you dare to light up? We live in a paranoid world overpopulated by ninnying jellyfish who dare not dip their toe in the water in case there\\'s a law against it, it might upset someone, or it might be bad for their health. Many people will read this article having lost loved ones as a result of smoking. Please don\\'t have a knee jerk emotional reaction, try to understand that the point I\\'m making - smoking is unhealthy but it is healthier than fascism and government regulation of personal habits leads to dictatorship. The fact that the very language and policies that we are now bombarded with as a justification for state regulation of our personal lifestyle choices are directly lifted from Nazi policies for racial hygiene from the 1930\\'s should alarm us all and act as a wake up call to the true agenda behind today\\'s anti-smoking purge.',\n",

It it all built into my hourly rate. I've had an hourly increase in my rate every year where as employees got a raise last year for the first time in 5 years. As for the people I work for, numerous of them have told me if I was to leave or retire, they would move to another division or retire themselves. I get paid that because I provide a value they can't get with an employee. BTW, I've been contracting with the same organization for 20 years.\",\n",

       "article_text         A man is suing both 18-year-old Christal McGee and Snapchat after the teen allegedly hit him with her car while trying to reach an impressive number on the app's speed filter, according to the official complaint. Wentworth Maynard spent five weeks in the ICU after the crash, which resulted in severe traumatic and physical injuries that left him unable to work.\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nMaynard's lawyer Michael L. Neff wrote on the night of Sept. 10, 2015, McGee pulled onto Hampton, Georgia's Tara Boulevard going more than 100 miles per hour. The road's speed limit is 55 miles per hour. McGee allegedly told the passengers in her car who were concerned about her speed (one of whom is pregnant) that she was \"just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat\" while filming in selfie mode with the speed filter on.\\n\\nMaynard, who is an Uber driver who was just beginning his shift at the time, merged onto the street and was allegedly hit so hard by McGee's car that his Outlander (pictured below right) shot across all four lanes of the highway into an embankment. A reenactment of the crash estimated McGee was going about 107 miles per hour at the time of impact.\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nMcGee's father's Mercedes (pictured above left) spun out, and she and her passengers were taken to a nearby hospital for minor injuries, which McGee allegedly documented on Snapchat (pictured top left) as well. Maynard is now completely dependent on a wheelchair or walker, and is struggling with communication, memory loss, and depression. He may not be left alone, his lawyer explained, so he is suing McGee and the app for extensive damages.\\n\\nNeff told CBS News \"This is a product liability case because Snapchat put something very dangerous in the marketplace without any warnings or safeguards.\" Neff also alleges the same speed filter has been responsible for some other recent deadly crashes as well.\\n\\nA Snapchat spokesman told KTLA he could not comment on the lawsuit but that the app has always included a warning not to use it while driving. McGee has not yet spoken publicly about the allegations.\\n\\nFollow Tess on Twitter.\n",

This is what happens when parents don't instill discipline, respect for others and common sense in their children. Little #$%$ run wild and think there special and \"lucky\" while never expecting to be punished. I have 4 kids and it will be cold day in hell if my kids act stupid. Yea their kids and do kid #$%$ but they have respect for others, use manners, are very disciplined and use common sense.   \n",

This is what happens when parents don't instill discipline, respect for others and common sense in their children. Little #$%$ run wild and think there special and 'lucky' while never expecting to be punished. I have xxnumber kids and it will be cold day in hell if my kids act stupid. Yea their kids and do kid #$%$ but they have respect for others, use manners, are very disciplined and use common sense.   \n",
