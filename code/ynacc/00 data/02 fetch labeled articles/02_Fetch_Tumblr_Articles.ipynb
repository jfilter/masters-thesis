      "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — On stage, Prince was still captivating audiences at recent performances in Australia and California. He hosted a pop-up party at his Paisley Park studio, and there were few outward signs in his final months that anything was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "But off stage, something was different. Prince began wanting meals that were easier to digest and was fighting off waves of sore throats and frequent upset stomachs, the musician’s personal chef told The Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "A law enforcement official has told the AP that investigators are looking into whether Prince, who was found dead at his home on April 21, died from an overdose and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks beforehand. The official has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ray Roberts, who cooked for Prince nearly every day for almost three years, said in an interview that wasn’t the man he saw nearly every night, “not even a hint. Not at all.” But Roberts did start noticing changes in Prince’s diet — he was eating less and drinking less water, and looked like he was losing weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It felt like he wasn’t himself probably the last month or two,” Roberts said. “I think he was just struggling with being sick a lot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince, who didn’t eat meat, normally loved foods like roasted beets and minestrone soup with a harissa chermoula, an herb sauce from North Africa. In recent months, Roberts said, as Prince would have sore throats or seem like he wasn’t feeling well for “weeks at a time,” he would prefer smoothies and fresh juices to soothe his throat or stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stomach and throat ailments aren’t unusual in a stubbornly cold Minnesota winter, and to the public, there was little to suggest something was amiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Prince’s death, fans who saw him recently have talked about his energy and his mesmerizing performances with just a microphone and a piano. Many who saw his final public appearance at Paisley Park only days before he died said he may have seemed more tired — one person who was at one of his last shows in Atlanta said his speaking voice was weak at times — but overall he was not changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He seemed fine. He looked normal and he had this kind of energetic glow that he always had,” said Lars Larson, a Minneapolis man who often worked at Paisley Park for Prince’s parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in private, Roberts said, Prince would soldier through and work. “It was amazing. I don’t think I ever saw him really looking bad ever. He was always on point,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roberts and his wife began cooking for Prince in 2013 after an informal tryout with several other chefs, and he made all his meals for the musician in the restaurant-grade kitchen at Paisley Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, Roberts would make light salads and soups — he said Prince particularly liked the roasted beets as well as a pesto broccolini dish. When Prince was gearing up for more shows and wanted to be more active, Roberts would scale back the sweets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for meat, there was none of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know if it was just an unwritten rule, but there was no meat there — ever,” he said. “If somebody wanted to eat meat, they would have to eat it in the parking lot. And he was very serious about this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roberts saw Prince nearly every day. He cooked for him every day except Sunday — and sometimes even then. Combined with the four Peoples Organic restaurants he and he wife run in the Twin Cities, Roberts said he was working about 100 hours a week, with his schedule tightly tethered to Prince’s. The musician would even bring Roberts and his wife on tour around the country at times to cook for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Roberts said it was a dream job and he relished the opportunity to listen to Prince practice and jam with other famous musicians, never knowing who he would be cooking for next. He said Prince had a “higher purpose” and that while he could be a joker or even cocky, most of the time he was a “caring, thoughtful person” who apologized if he was running late and considered his employees family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish he was still here,” he said, wiping away a tear. “That’s what it boils down to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roberts last saw Prince the evening before the musician was found dead at Paisley Park. He cooked Prince a roasted red pepper bisque with a kale and spring vegetable salad. But Prince never ate it. When he returned to the musician’s studio home for his memorial service a few days later, Roberts found it in the refrigerator — just as he’d left it.\n",

      "Last season, The Voice implemented a new gimmick twist called the “Coach Comeback,” which allowed (well, actually, forced) each coach to invite a previously eliminated contestant to compete in the Live Playoffs. Some fans cried foul at the time, arguing that this wasn’t fair to the 20 contestants who’d made it through all three taped rounds (the Blinds, the Battles, and the Knockouts) fair and square. But then none of the Comeback picks made it through to last season’s top 12 anyway, so it was a moot point.\n",
      "\n",
      "This season, things have panned out differently. On Wednesday’s first live results show of Season 10, there were many shockers – and I’m not even referring to the fact that The Voice gave long-neglected Season 1 winner Javier Colon some actual screentime AND referred to him as “Voice royalty!” (Unfortunately, Javier was then pushed aside, after getting about 20 seconds to plug his new album, so that reigning Voice king Jordan Smith could perform.)\n",
      "\n",
      "(photos courtesy of NBC)\n",
      "\n",
      "But I digress. My point is, two of this season’s last-minute Comeback artists shockingly made it through to the top 12 this Wednesday, via the public vote – effectively stealing those spots from contestants who at one time had seemed like frontrunners. Judging from my Twitter feed, Voice fans were not amused. And clearly even less thrilled were the members of Team Xtina, the talent-packed team most adversely affected by this Coach Comeback stunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christina Aguilera had already built a formidable team before she brought back Nick Hagelin (an ex-Team Pharrell contestant) for Monday’s Playoffs; she definitely did not need him diluting her ranks. It’s not that Nick didn’t deserve a second chance at some screentime (he actually should have won his Knockout Round a couple weeks ago), but did he deserve to get more votes than Bryan Bautista, Tamar Davis, Kata Hay, and Ryan Quinn? That’s definitely up for debate. But that’s exactly what happened. (Side note: Not all of Wednesday’s results were shocking. Of course golden girl Alisan Porter survived.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Christina made the right choice by saving the phenomenal Bryan (each coach got to pick one contestant to join the top two voter-getters, per team). But I would have never expected someone like Ryan to go home this soon. I don’t think Christina expected it either, judging by how she hemmed and hawed and stalled and agonized while making her on-air decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Team Pharrell’s results also featured a Comeback curveball. Obviously, it was no shock that pre-school-teaching powerhouse Hannah Huston made it through via America’s vote, but it was surprising was that Daniel Passino – a Coach Comeback pick and former Team Xtina contestant who sang first Tuesday, in the “death spot” – was also voted through. I had assumed that Daniel was fodder, and thought Emily Keener (whom Pharrell later saved), Moushimi, or especially Caity Peters had a better shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Team Pharrell’s final three)\n",
      "\n",
      "Team Adam’s Comeback pick, the fodder-y Nate Butler, did not survive the vote (thank gawd), and pint-sized powerhouse Shalyah Fearing prevailed, as expected. But when hairy blues-rocker Laith Al-Saadi got through, that was another Wednesday surprise – at least to Adam Levine, whose eyebrows shot right up to his hairline upon hearing Carson Daly announce the news. (Later, when deciding which contestant to save, Adam even stopped himself mid-sentence as he blurted out, “I hadn’t expected…”) It’s not that Laith did a bad job this week; on the contrary, his “With a Little Help From My Friends” was one of Tuesday’s standout performances. But I don’t think Adam ever thought he’d be in the position of having to choose to save either Owen Danoff or Caroline Burns. Adam made the right call; this season just would not be the same without Owen, and Adam realized that. But it was a shame to say goodbye to sweet Caroline, just as she was coming into her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all those wackadoodle results, allow me to gloat a bit and point out that I predicted Team Blake’s results with 100 percent accuracy. Of course, everyone probably assumed that Adam Wakefield and Mary Sarah would dominate the votes, but it seems some of you Twitter-ers out there are shocked that Blake Shelton saved Paxton Ingram, when he could have predictably stuck with (admittedly worthy) country contestants like Katie Basden and Justin Whisnant. But I’m not surprised, nor am I displeased. I’m delighted that Blake saved a dynamic showman like Paxton. With a top 12 featuring some inconsistent and/or downright boring performers, we are going to need Paxton’s energy this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to recap, Team Xtina now consists of Alisan Porter, Nick Hagelin, and Bryan Bautista. (I would have swapped Nick for Ryan Quinn or Kata Hay.) Team Pharrell has Hannah Huston, Daniel Passino, and Emily Keener. (I would have replaced Daniel with Caity Peters.) Team Adam has Shalyah Fearing, Laith Al-Saadi, and Owen Danoff. (I’m OK with this result, although Caroline Burns would have been an acceptable alternative to Laith.) And Team Blake comprises Adam Wakefield, Mary Sarah, and Paxton Ingram. (I’m totally on board with this particular lineup.)\n",

      "Obviously, this isn’t exactly the final dozen I’d envisioned (or that maybe the coaches envisioned). And I am still not convinced that this won’t be the dullest Voice season ever, though I remain cautiously optimistic. Can Season 10 come back from the Comebacks? Watch this space, when the top 12 compete next Monday.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — In a stark warning for Donald Trump as he eyes a possible general election showdown with Hillary Clinton, Americans trust the Democratic front-runner more than the Republican businessman to handle a wide range of issues — from immigration to health care to nominating Supreme Court justices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when asked which of the two candidates would be best at “making American great” — the central promise of Trump’s campaign — Americans are slightly more likely to side with Clinton, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey does reveal some potential trouble spots for Clinton. Trump is nearly even with her on whom Americans trust to handle the economy, which voters consistently rank as one of the top issues facing the country. Clinton is trusted more on the economy by 38 percent of Americans, while 35 percent side with Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite Americans’ overall preference for Clinton on a host of issues, just 20 percent say she represents their own views very well on matters they care about, while 23 percent say somewhat well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as with most issues addressed in the AP-GfK poll, the numbers for Trump are even worse: Just 15 percent of Americans say he represents their views very well and 14 percent say somewhat well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s support with registered Republican voters is also soft on some issues, with less than 50 percent saying they trust him over Clinton on working with Congress or handling the U.S. image abroad. About a quarter of Republicans say they trust neither candidate on either of those issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those figures underscore the work the real estate mogul must do to shore up support within his own party if he’s the nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greg Freeman, an independent who leans Republican, said he would “absolutely not” trust Trump to handle major issues facing the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think he would have the U.S. in wars at the drop of a hat. He would make the international community angry at the United States,” said Freeman, a 41-year-old from Walhalla, South Carolina. “He has a lot of comments on issues, but he has no solutions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Clinton and Trump are the favorites to face off in the fall campaign, obstacles remain, particularly for the Republican billionaire. He’s leading in the delegate count, but needs to perform better in the upcoming final primaries in order to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. If he fails to hit that number, the GOP contest will be decided at the party’s convention in July — and it’s unclear whether Trump’s slim campaign operation is prepared for that complex challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton has yet to shake Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator who has energized young voters with his calls for breaking up Wall Street banks and making tuition free at public colleges and universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Sanders faces tough odds of overtaking Clinton, who has a commanding lead in delegates, his continued presence in the race has rankled the former secretary of state and prevented her from fully turning her attention toward the general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Clinton has been starting to draw a contrast with her potential Republican opponents, namely Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his closest rival.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m really looking forward to debating either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz,” Clinton said Friday. “Mr. Trump, tell me again about how you’re going to build this wall and make the Mexicans pay for it. Tell me again why you think it’s a good idea for Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s campaign appears well-aware of the need to bolster the businessman’s policy credentials. He’s recently expanded on his foreign policy views, including questioning U.S. participation in the NATO military alliance and suggesting some Asian nations may need nuclear weapons. Campaign officials have also said Trump plans to give a series of policy speeches in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton’s edge over Trump on the issues spans foreign and domestic policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She holds a significant advantage on handling immigration, health care, the U.S. image abroad, filling Supreme Court vacancies, international trade and working with Congress. Her biggest advantage is on handling gender equality issues, with 55 percent of Americans trusting her and just 12 percent backing Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton has a slimmer lead over Trump on which candidate is trusted to protect the country, with 37 percent backing the Democrat and 31 percent backing the Republican. The margin is similar when Americans were asked who they trusted to handle the threat posed by the Islamic State group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of Trump’s appeal with voters has rested on his broad pledge to “make America great again.” But when asked which candidate they trusted more to make the country great, 33 percent of Americans picked Clinton and 28 percent backed Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty percent said they didn’t trust either candidate to make that happen.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — Letantia Bussell, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, says she appreciates Donald Trump’s “unique personality.” Peter Zieve, an engineer in Washington, loves Trump because “the guy’s a person, not a robot.” Daniel Arias, an El Salvadoran immigrant in Florida, is positive Trump will put an end to newcomers “coming here and begging for food stamps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They are the few, the proud, the maxed-out Trump donors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader of the Republican presidential contest ridicules donors and insists he is a billionaire who wants to “self-fund.” Yet there’s a prominent “donate” button on his campaign website, and he has raised more than $9.5 million, including from about 200 people who have given $2,700, the maximum allowed by law for the primary election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it’s such a relatively small sample — a tiny sliver compared with Hillary Clinton’s nearly 29,000 maxed-out donors — it’s impossible to reach broad conclusions about Trump’s benefactors. Still, these are arguably the most loyal of Trump fans, and their interviews with The Associated Press reveal unexpected layers of the political newcomer’s appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re both attracted and repelled by Trump’s inflammatory comments. Just like the thousands who attend Trump’s massive rallies, these well-off fans want dramatic change and see Trump as the only person capable of making it happen. And far from being embarrassed by their candidate, the donors seem to love converting their friends and associates to the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "HELP NOT WANTED\n",
      "\n",
      "First things first: Why did the donors decide to give to a candidate who belittles them? Trump recently said of his campaign donors’ help, “Whatever. It’s peanuts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bussell didn’t set out to give the candidate money. She wanted to write him a letter of encouragement in August. But when she saw the donate option on his web page, she decided financial help was a better way to show support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donating is taking action. And just as Phillip Braunstein likes politicians who “walk the walk, not only talk the talk,” he felt compelled to do more than just say he likes Trump. That’s why the 33-year-old Los Angeles real estate business owner laid down his $2,700 in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "__\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO’S GIVING\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of maxed-out donors includes some characters. Literally. There’s Alice Chapman, a reality television star and the wife of Dog the Bounty Hunter. There’s Jim Shore, a well-known artist who sells his figurines on QVC. Kelly Roberts has also chipped in. She’s the mother of two “television personalities,” wife of a millionaire frozen-burrito king and co-owner of the historic Mission Inn Hotel and Spa in Riverside, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people who part ways with several thousand dollars are on firm financial footing. Some of Trump’s donors are downright rich. John Ferolito, who co-founded AriZona iced tea, gave in July. And Scott Shleifer, head of the multi-billion-dollar New York hedge fund Tiger Global, ponied up $2,700 last year, a few months before he purchased an $18 million Park Avenue condo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AP culled the names of Trump’s top donors from his public Federal Election Commission filings, which are complete through the end of February. More contributors will emerge on Wednesday, when he files his March fundraising documents.\n",

      "The 75-year-old real estate investor in Coconut Grove said he came to the country legally, thanks to sisters already here and visas that made it easier for family members to emigrate, some 30 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s the only one who is going to do something to stop illegal immigration,” said Arias, who contends many come here for the government benefits and “to steal and sell drugs.” Trump famously kicked off his campaign by saying some Mexican immigrants who entered the country illegally are “rapists.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Arias is far from alone in parroting Trump’s saltier language and buzz words. More than one said they like Trump because they think he will make America great again, which happens to be his slogan, emblazoned on red ball caps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Al Gamble, a Connecticut restaurant owner, said he gave to Trump in October because he is tired of families like the Bushes and the Clintons, who have “raped this country to assist in the globalist’s agenda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "LIKE CANDIDATE, LIKE DONOR\n",
      "\n",
      "And some of the donors seem to have adopted Trump’s tone on his opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think Trump has the best chance of winning, and I only back winners,” Braunstein said. He liked Marco Rubio and others, but asked himself, “why would I spend my money on a loser?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many who spoke with AP said they could do without some of Trump’s incendiary rhetoric but didn’t hold that against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love the Trump ideas,” Gamble said. “The way he delivers that message is terrible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zieve, an engineer who said he conducts business around the world and is a longtime Republican Party donor, said he’s “not proud of some the silly stuff he’s said.” He cited Trump’s recent assertion that if abortions are outlawed, the women who have them should be punished (Trump quickly walked that back).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes I wish he would put a zipper on it,” Zieve said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, that no-holds-barred approach has kept him riveted — and supportive. Zieve gave $2,700 at the end of February.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every time something comes out of his mouth, it’s exactly something that would come out of my mouth,” he said. One example: When Mexican leaders dismissed Trump’s demand that they pay for his proposed border wall, Trump declared the wall “just got 10 feet higher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bingo! That’s the right answer. I love that guy!” Zieve said. His bottom line on Trump sounds a lot like something Trump would say: “We are getting screwed around the world because we don’t have a leader. He is a leader.”\n",

      "___\n",
      "\n",
      "WINNING OVER OTHERS\n",
      "\n",
      "Bussell, the dermatologist, said she gave because she likes Trump, though she hasn’t met him. She’s from New Jersey and said she spends lots of time explaining to her West Coast friends — and Beverly Hills patients — that Trump has “a certain sense of humor” and doesn’t precisely mean everything he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s refreshing. He has an incredible loyalty to our country and a strong desire to see the people of our country do well and be happy,” she said. “We don’t need more of the same. We need a change. It’s as if the country is in need of a significant oil change and he is the best mechanic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Worthington, who is in Las Vegas real estate development and describes himself as a “bleeding-heart conservative,” said he readily engages friends on Trump — and often finds they end up liking him. Trump’s plain talk about trade deals being bad for the U.S. is a big point of agreement, he said. “Even my liberal girlfriend actually likes him,” he said. “She’s from New York.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zieve insisted the support for Trump is broader than people think: “I work with a lot of bright people. And the brightest are all for Trump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Public opinion surveys throw a bit of cold water on his theory. Seven in 10 Americans, including close to half of Republican voters, have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to an AP-Gfk poll this month.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first person to donate $2,700 to Trump’s presidential bid, weeks before he even glided down the escalator in his New York tower and declared his candidacy, was Pamela Newman, a friend and a longtime insurance provider for Trump’s business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign has been good to her, as well: Between June and February, it paid the branch of Aon Risk Services where she works almost $300,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet not all of those who know Trump and gave him money are doing so for the usual reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Kaminkow, a well-known game developer, met Trump years ago when designing a slot-machine version of “The Apprentice,” Trump’s hit TV show.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From my one-on-one dealings with him, he’s a gentleman,” Kaminkow said. He thinks Trump is right about some policy issues, too, such as making trade deals more favorable to the U.S. “But the question is, who do you want answering the call at 3 a.m.? I think we need a president who maintains our stability and strength with understanding. And he isn’t behaving in that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So why the heck did Kaminkow give Trump $2,700 in August?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’m a Democrat, and I feel like Hillary Clinton is the most qualified person in the race,” he said. “But I was so entertained by what I saw from the Republicans on TV that I wanted to do my part to keep that party going.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Genesee District Judge Tracy Collier-Nix authorized charges against Flint employee Michael Glasgow and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) employees Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glasgow, 40, was charged with tampering with evidence and willful neglect of duty, according to court documents.\n",

      "Busch, 40, and Prysby, 53, were each charged with six counts, including misconduct in office, tampering with evidence and violation of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, according to court documents. Busch, a district manager in the drinking water division, had already been suspended.\n",

      "Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette told a news conference to announce the charges that it was “only the beginning and there will be more to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three people charged could not immediately be reached for comment. Glasgow faces up to five years in prison and $6,000 in fines, while the two MDEQ officials each face up to 20 years in prison and $45,000 in fines, according to court documents.\n",

      "Flint, which has about 100,000 people, was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its source of water from Detroit’s municipal system to the Flint River to save money. The city switched back in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system’s and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children are showing dangerously high blood levels of lead.\n",

      "INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton rolled up wins in Northeastern states on Tuesday in a major show of strength and immediately turned their fire on each other in a possible preview of a general election matchup.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York billionaire easily defeated rivals John Kasich and Ted Cruz in all five states that held contests, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, with a margin of victory rivaling that of his home state of New York a week ago. He was on a path to winning the vote in every county in each state.\n",

      "Clinton, already in control of the Democratic race, defeated challenger Bernie Sanders in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Her only loss of the night was to Sanders in Rhode Island.\n",

      "The race now pivots immediately to Indiana, which is shaping up to be Cruz’s best, and perhaps last, chance to slow Trump’s momentum toward the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, can win a large share of the state’s 57 delegates on May 3, it will boost the chances that Trump will not be able to amass the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination before the party’s convention in July. That could give Cruz a shot at convincing delegates to back him for president instead.\n",

      "A loss to Trump in Indiana would effectively cripple Cruz’s already faltering bid, and increase pressure on the party to rally around Trump as the prospective nominee.\n",

      "Trump, who is to give a foreign policy speech in Washington on Wednesday, criticized Clinton’s record as secretary of state and her vote as a U.S. senator from New York in support of the Iraq war.

Kasich, the Ohio governor, won five, all from Rhode Island, and Cruz one, with seven delegates still to be assigned. Pennsylvania’s 54 unbound delegates will become clearer later.\n",

      "“I consider myself the presumptive nominee,” he said, adding later: “As far as I’m concerned, this thing is over.”\n",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — In an extraordinary move, Donald Trump’s Republican rivals late Sunday announced plans to coordinate primary strategies in upcoming states to deprive the GOP front-runner of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ted Cruz and John Kasich issued near-simultaneous statements outlining an agreement that may be unprecedented in modern American politics. The Kasich campaign will give Cruz “a clear path in Indiana.” In return, the Cruz campaign will “clear the path” for Kasich in Oregon and New Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrangement does not address the five Northeastern states set to vote on Tuesday, where Trump is expected to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead. Kasich and Cruz had already retreated to Indiana, which holds its primary on May 3. Yet the shift offers increasingly desperate Trump foes a glimmer of hope in their long and frustrating fight to halt the former reality television star’s unlikely rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,” Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said in a statement explaining the new plans. “Not only would Trump get blown out by Clinton or Sanders, but having him as our nominee would set the party back a generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Added Kasich’s chief strategist, John Weaver, “Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement marks a sharp reversal for Cruz’s team, which aggressively opposed coordinating anti-Trump efforts with Kasich as recently as late last week. And it only applies to Indiana, Oregon and New Mexico — three of the 15 states remaining on the Republican primary calendar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the development underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessman’s Republican foes: Time is running out to stop him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump responded on Twitter shortly before midnight: “Wow, just announced that Lyin’ Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire leads in many polls. Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland, which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to several thousand people in an airplane hangar in Hagerstown, Maryland, Sunday evening, Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1,237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "SLIDESHOW – Candidates vie for 5 Northeastern states >>>\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only care about the first. We’re not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth,” said Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Kasich backs out of Indiana, Cruz promised to not compete in primary contests in Oregon on May 17 and New Mexico on June 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will focus our time and resources in New Mexico and Oregon, both areas that are structurally similar to the Northeast politically, where Gov. Kasich is performing well,” Weaver said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As recently as three days ago Kasich’s campaign announced investments in Indiana, including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership team. His campaign on Sunday night canceled a town hall and gathering in Indianapolis scheduled to watch the results of Tuesday’s primaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Cruz’s campaign, Kasich’s campaign encouraged allied super PACs and other outside groups to “honor the commitments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly denounced the GOP’s presidential nominating system as “rigged.” That criticism is likely to intensify in the coming days.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was far less drama on the Democratic side Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underdog Bernie Sanders rallied thousands of voters in two New England states, seeking momentum even as he offered mixed signals on how hard he would push his differences with front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vermont senator largely steered clear of Clinton at a Rhode Island park, but hours later ramped up his critique before more than 14,000 supporters in New Haven, Connecticut. Sanders reiterated his call for Clinton to release transcripts of lucrative Wall Street speeches she delivered after leaving the State Department in early 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This campaign, unlike Secretary Clinton’s, has not raised $15 million from Wall Street and millions more from other special interests,” he said as the crowd booed at the mention of Clinton’s name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton eyed victories in four or five of Tuesday’s contests, which would all but cripple Sanders’ White House bid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former secretary of state went to two Philadelphia church services attended largely by African-Americans ahead of the primary in Pennsylvania, Tuesday’s top delegate prize. She declined to attack her Democratic rival by name in the morning appearance and a subsequent stop in Bridgeport, Connecticut, focusing on the GOP candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz downplayed tensions between Sanders and Clinton, whose rivalry has become increasingly nasty in recent weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Regardless of the intensity of what’s played out here … we are going to be unified,” she declared.\n",

      "“I have always said that the Lord has a purpose for me, as he has for everyone. And as I suspend my campaign today, I have renewed faith, deeper faith that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life,” Kasich said.\n",

      "\n",
      "“When we hit our 100th town hall, it was remarkable. Those beautiful towns,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point while campaigning, for instance, he said he told his staff to look up from their smartphones to appreciate the “magical” winter wonderland of New Hampshire before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he was bowled over time and again by the kindness and warmth of his fellow citizens.\n",

      "“We all remember that hug in South Carolina from that young man,” he said. “He just wanted to give me a hug … and the country marveled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasich said that humans are hardwired to help others and receive help in kind: “It’s a virtuous circle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The spirit, the essence of America, lies in the hearts and souls of us,” he said. “You see, some missed this message: It wasn’t sexy. It wasn’t a great sound bite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier Wednesday, many speculated that Kasich planned to suspend his campaign after he abruptly canceled a planned press conference in Virginia. This was followed by several reports — from NBC News, CNN and other media outlets — confirming the rumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night before, Kasich appeared to be moving forward. After a disappointing finish in the Indiana primary, his campaign released a memo saying that the night’s results would not change his plans to keep pushing ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention,” the memo reads in part.\n",
      "\n",
      "This apparent commitment to stay in the race was reinforced by a Twitter post parodying the “Star Wars” opening crawl. It argued that he would have a better chance than Trump of beating likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared to accept Trump as the inevitable face of the GOP race in a tweet Tuesday night after the real estate magnate’s win in Indiana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling Trump the “presumptive nominee,” Priebus tweeted, “We all need to unite and focus on defeating Hillary Clinton.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“We’ve got a candidate that is winning in every single state. I mean, a week earlier, I don’t think he had lost a county in six states,” he said of Trump. “So I mean, look, it’s time to unite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he stopped short of saying Kasich should drop out when Camerota asked if that would help unify the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, obviously, that’s up to John Kasich,” he said. “He’s got his own platform and his own agenda that he’s running, and I’m going to leave that up to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz suspended his campaign Tuesday night after the Indiana primary results rolled in. Early on, Cruz resisted publicly attacking Trump in the hope that his supporters would join him after the Trump media frenzy waned. But as Trump continued to dominate the primaries and as the field of candidates thinned, Cruz went after the frontrunner, receiving the nickname “Lyin’ Ted” from the master-brander in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasich had been a long-shot candidate ever since the first Republican presidential debates last summer. The stage was already overcrowded with establishment favorites and political outsiders. As the election dragged on, it became clear that his campaign had more or less turned into a spoiler aimed at preventing Trump from getting the requisite 1,237 delegates to clinch the party’s nod without a contested convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was scheduled to speak in Virginia at 10:45 a.m. on Wednesday but never appeared. His run for the Oval Office will come to a close with only one state primary win: his home state of Ohio.\n",

      "\n",
      "Camille Cosby answered questions under oath for about 5 ½ hours, according to Joe Cammarata, a lawyer for the women. Cammarata wouldn’t discuss specifics of questions he asked during the civil deposition in Boston.\n",

      "CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The growing number of patients who claim marijuana helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates, who are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics like heroin, as well as an alternative to painkillers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis, with a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for the addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. And a study published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids — Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers — and heroin, and many medical professionals say it’s not enough for them to confidently prescribe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a yearslong addiction to painkillers she took for a bad back and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tired of feeling “like a zombie,” the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. She gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control. And she hasn’t gone back on the opioids.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before, I couldn’t even function. I couldn’t get anything done,” Ham said. “Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bolstered by stories like Ham’s, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana, and Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think it’s a cure for everybody,” said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. “But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it’s working?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n",

      "“It’s hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,” said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. “But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.”\n",

      "There are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,” said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School’s Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,” he said. “However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n",

      "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, addressing a Vatican conference on social justice on Friday, decried the “immoral” gap between the world’s rich and poor that he said was worse than a century ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a vow to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of Pope Francis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip is inconveniently timed for 74-year-old senator, coming four days before a Democratic party primary in New York. A loss there would blunt his momentum after winning seven of the last eight state contests and give front-runner Hillary Clinton a boost in her drive to the party’s presidential nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders said in his speech to the Pontifical Academy of Social Science that the Roman Catholic Church’s first encyclical on social justice, written in 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, lamented the enormous gap between the rich and the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That situation is worse today. In the year 2016, the top 1 percent of the people on this planet own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent,” the self-described democratic socialist said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will be back on the campaign trail on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHANTS OF “BERNIE, BERNIE” AT VATICAN GATE After reading the speech in the academy building inside the Vatican grounds, Sanders walked outside one of the city-state’s gates to talk to reporters and was greeted by chants of “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie” from a vocal group of local supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pope Francis sent a message to the academy, saying he had wanted to meet the conference participants in the evening, but could not because he is leaving Rome early on Saturday to visit refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying he was “proud and excited to be here”, Sanders praised the pope’s visionary views about creating “a moral economy, an economy that works for all people and not just for the people on top”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting the themes of his campaign, he said he and the pope both agreed that “we’ve got to ingrain moral principles into our economy and there is no area where that is clearer than the area of climate change. The greed of the fossil fuel industry is literally destroying our planet”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pope Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal treatise, last year on the need to respect the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other parts of his speech, Sanders decried “reckless financial deregulation,” including rules on political party financing, that he said had “established a system in which billionaires can buy elections” in exchange for laws that would make them only richer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, we have been left with an economy operated for the top one percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders will spend less than 24 hours in Rome before returning to the campaign trail before the New York primary on Tuesday.\n",

      "VATICAN CITY (AP) — Bernie Sanders issued a global call to action at the Vatican Friday to address “immoral and unsustainable” wealth inequality and poverty, using the high profile gathering to echo one of the central platforms of his presidential campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic senator from Vermont cited Pope Francis and St. John Paul II repeatedly during his speech to the Vatican conference commemorating the 25th anniversary of a landmark teaching document from John Paul on social and economic justice after the Cold War.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders arrived in Rome hours after wrapping up a debate in New York Thursday night, saying the opportunity to address the Vatican conference was too meaningful to pass up. The roughly 24-hour visit precedes Tuesday’s crucial New York primary, which Sanders must do well in to maintain any viable challenge against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told the audience of priests, bishops, academics and two South American presidents that rather than a world economy that looks out for the common good, “we have been left with an economy operated for the top 1 percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During a discussion later in the afternoon, Sanders was peppered with questions from academics and ecclesiastics at the conference, giving the presidential hopeful a chance to expand on his core campaign messages about the need to reform banking regulations, campaign finance rules and higher education.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t choose to politicize the pope,” Sanders told attendees, “but his spirit and courage and the fact, if I may say so here, that his words have gone way, way, way beyond the Catholic Church.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, Sanders warned that youth around the world are no longer satisfied with the status quo, which includes “corrupt and broken politics and an economy of stark inequality and injustice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are not satisfied with the destruction of our environment by a fossil fuel industry whose greed has put short term profits ahead of climate change and the future of our planet,” he said. “They are calling out for a return to fairness; for an economy that defends the common good by ensuring that every person, rich or poor, has access to quality health care, nutrition and education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat next to the other main guest of honor at the Vatican: Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose is renowned for his anti-imperialist, socialist rhetoric.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked through Vatican City’s Perugino gate, Sanders was greeted about two dozen supporters, some of whom carried signs bearing Sanders’ name.\n",
      "\n",
      "The senator told reporters that he was honored to address the conference and admired Francis’ message on the economy and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that it’s taking me away from the campaign trail for a day but when I received this information it was so moving to me that it was something that I could just simply not refuse to attend,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pope Francis apologized that he couldn’t personally greet participants at the Vatican conference. No meeting with Sanders was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanders was accompanied on the trip by his wife, Jane Sanders, and 10 family members, including four grandchildren.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conference was organized by a Vatican advisory group comparable to a think-tank that Francis appointed to guide him on a wide range of public policy issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back home, Clinton holds a significant delegate lead against Sanders, but the senator has vowed to stay in the campaign until the party’s July convention. His message calling for a political revolution to address wealth inequality and the influence of Wall Street on U.S. politics has galvanized many Democrats and independents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being enmeshed in an increasingly bitter campaign against Clinton, Sanders aides said the trip was not aimed at appealing to Catholic voters who comprise a large share of the Democratic electorate in New York and an upcoming contest in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vatican has been loath to get involved in electoral campaigns and usually tries to avoid any perception of partisanship involving the pope. Popes rarely travel to countries during the thick of political campaigns, knowing a papal photo opportunity with a sitting head of state could be exploited for political ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the invitation to Sanders to address the Vatican conference raised eyebrows and allegations that the senator lobbied for the invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancellor for the pontifical academy, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, has said he invited Sanders because he was the only U.S. presidential candidate who showed deep interest in the teachings of Francis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other attendees included Morales of Bolivia and President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, along with Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras, a member of the academy, and Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs, an adviser to the United Nations on environmental and sustainability issues. Sachs has advised Sanders on foreign policy issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rev. Matt Malone, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said Sanders’ trip was unlikely to have much of an impact on Catholic voters, noting that conferences like the one Sanders is attending “happen all the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think that Bernie Sanders going to the Vatican is going to help Bernie with Catholics any more than Ted Cruz going to a matzo factory is going to help him with the Jewish vote,” said Malone, who served as a speechwriter to former Rep. Marty Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Popes rarely attend such events and do so only if the topic is of special interest and there is room in their schedule, Malone said.\n",

      "\n",
      "A high school student was left in tears when she was told she would be denied entry to her prom because her dress was “too revealing.” Facebook user Tiffani Taylor posted an image of Amy, who was attending prom at Maryville High in Tennessee, rocking her gorgeous prom dress. In the image, we see Amy smiling proudly in her gown, but the caption itself tells quite a different story.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arriving at the prom, she was stopped at the door. She would not be allowed in because her dress was ‘too revealing,’ Taylor wrote. “After spending some time in the restroom crying, she was told she could go in if she wore the vice principal’s tux jacket, which, mind you, did not cover her chest. She was told by a teacher repeatedly ‘Us big girls gotta cover up.’ This young girl was SHAMED for having breasts. Her excitement during this memorable time of her life turned into embarrassment at the hands of adults who are supposed to be leading her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The photo has been shared more than 19,000 times, and many of the commenters on the photo are just as bewildered as Taylor was as to why Amy was asked to wear a bulky jacket. “She looks STUNNING. I don’t understand who would think she needs to cover up,” one person wrote. “She is gorgeous and her dress is beautiful. How is this inappropriate??? I have seen many others much more inappropriate! This dress is classy!!” another said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A girl who appears to have attended the prom was quick to point out the double standard, mentioning the fact that she saw dresses that were even more revealing than Amy’s at the dance. “My own dress had quite a few cutouts in the back, yet that wasn’t too much. I saw other girls with dresses lower cut and yet they weren’t called out. I was disappointed in how it was handled for sure.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Self-made millionaires are very particular about who they associate with,” Corley writes in his book, “Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.” “You are only as successful as those you frequently associate with. The rich are always on the lookout for individuals who are goal-oriented, optimistic, enthusiastic, and who have an overall positive mental outlook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighty-six percent of the rich people in his study made a habit out of associating with other success-minded individuals. On the flip side, “they also make a point to limit their exposure to toxic, negative people,” he explains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of substituting negative friends and acquaintances for positive individuals stems from the fact that positivity was a hallmark of the rich people he studied — and we emulate the people we associate with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long-term success is only possible when you have a positive mental outlook,” Corley states.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s not the only one to suggest that negativity derails success — or that your relationships could affect your financial success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly a century ago, journalist Napoleon Hill drew similar conclusions after researching over 500 self-made millionaires. “Men take on the nature and the habits and the power of thought of those with who they associate,” he wrote in his 1937 bestseller, “Think and Grow Rich,” and “there is no hope of success for the person who repels people through a negative personality.”\n",

      "And so, it’s all over. Kieran has dimmed the lights for the last time. Seacrest is “out” for good. On Thursday night, American Idol came to an end after 15 seasons, crowning soulful farm boy Trent Harmon as its “Kelly Clarkson bookend” winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether Trent or his worthy opponent La’Porsha Renae won Idol Season 15 was pretty much an afterthought on this throwback-Thursday spectacular. Lovingly produced by the triumphantly returning Nigel Lythgoe (who helmed the show during its first seven classic seasons, as well as Seasons 10-12), Idol’s grand finale was more a celebration of the series’ glorious past than an acknowledgment of its present or possible future. And sure, Trent, La’Porsha, and rest of this year’s cast may not have been too thrilled by the fact that they were basically relegated to stagehand status – the top 10’s practically only significant time onstage during the 126-minute broadcast was an awkward moment when they wheeled out a commemorative neon sign (a gift for veteran host Ryan Seacrest). I did feel a little sorry for those kids.\n",

      "But I, for one, was not complaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, this finale was pretty much perfect (aside from a planned “Moment Like This” singalong getting cut due to lack of time and the notable absence of any Michael Johns tribute). It was everything all sorts of Idol nostalgists – from the live-tweeting diehards, to the fairweather fans who dropped off in recent seasons – could have hoped for. Why? Because unlike most talent show finales, this wasn’t some filler-padded affair with performances by Pitbull, Nick Jonas, and whatever other pop star might have a current single to shill. No, it was ALL IDOLS ALL THE TIME. Even Brian Dunkleman, General Larry Platt, William Hung, Sanjaya Malakar, Kara DioGuardi, and the original Randy/Paula/Simon dream team showed up.

Diana DeGarmo! David Archuleta! Katharine McPhee! Jessica Sanchez! Taylor Hicks! Jordin Sparks! Melinda Doolittle! Scotty McCreery! Allison Iraheta! Bo Bice! Pia Toscano!

It started with somewhat forgotten Season 8/9 fourth judge Kara DioGuardi storming out singing (thankfully not doing the terrible coronation song she penned for Kris Allen, “No Boundaries,” but her more successful composition for Pink, “Sober”), followed by CCM piano man Colton Dixon doing his own “Through All of It”; Justin Guarini taking on the Chris Brown role in “No Air” alongside Jordin Sparks; Kimberley Locke crooning her hit single “8th World Wonder”; and Tamyra Gray belting Little Big Town’s “Girl Crush.” And then, the good General Larry Platt bumrushed Allison Iraheta’s fierce, fantastic cover of Meghan Trainor’s “No” with a brief, bizarre mashup of his viral Season 9 audition hit “Pants on the Ground,” before things got serious again with Pia Toscano’s “All By Myself.” None of it made any sense.

While she had so many hits to cram into her five-minute number, it all felt a little rushed, her a cappella rendition of the song that started it all for her, “A Moment Like This,” was everything. More tears fell.\n",

      "\n",
      "Idol’s original co-host became the butt of many jokes, and became known as the Pete Best of TV hosting, when he left the show after Season 1. So it was wonderful to see him back in the spotlight again, reuniting with Ryan Seacrest and having a great sense of humor about the whole thing. “No one knows the pain of knowing a life without Idol more than me,” he smirkingly warned the soon-to-be-unemployed Seacrest; he also congratulated the show for “struggling for 14 more seasons” without him. This was a more enjoyable comeback than Platt’s or Hung’s. Can The Voice hire Dunkleman to be its new co-host?\n",

Katharine McPhee, Casey James, Ruben Studdard, and Amber Holcomb all impressed, but the real stars of this acoustic medley were Carly Smithson, Clay Aiken (back despite trashing the show on Twitter weeks ago, and sounding fantastic), and pop princess Jessica Sanchez. So much talent, all on one stage… this was magical.\n",

      "3. All These Young Dudes… Were Fantastic\n",

      "I’m not going to lie: I was concerned that a David Bowie tribute starring the five “WGWG” winners – David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Nick Fradiani, and prodigal Idol son Phillip Phillips (who’s currently suing Idol’s parent company, 19 Entertainment) – would be a misfire. But instead it just made we wish there had been a Bowie Night during one of these guys’ Idol seasons. This worked shockingly well.

This was such a blast. (I’d go see these guys on a joint tour, too.) The only thing that could have made this better was the addition of a couple female rockers. Why not Carly or Allison?

(AP) — In a story April 21 about a presentation made by Donald Trump’s chief lieutenants at an RNC meeting in Florida, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Trump aide Paul Manafort said, “You’ll see a real different guy.” The correct quote is: “You’ll see a real different way.”\n",

      "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump’s chief lieutenants told skeptical Republican leaders Thursday that the GOP front-runner has been “projecting an image” so far in the 2016 primary season and “the part that he’s been playing is now evolving” in a way that will improve his standing among general election voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message, delivered behind closed doors in a private briefing, is part of the campaign’s intensifying effort to convince party leaders Trump will moderate his tone in the coming months to help deliver big electoral gains this fall, despite his contentious ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as his team pressed Trump’s case, he raised fresh concern among some conservatives by speaking against North Carolina’s “bathroom law,” which directs transgender people to use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificates. Trump also came out against the federal government’s plan to replace President Andrew Jackson with the civil-rights figure Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The developments came as the GOP’s messy fight for the White House spilled into a seaside resort in south Florida. While candidates in both parties fanned out across the country before important primary contests in the Northeast, Hollywood’s Diplomat Resort & Spa was transformed into a palm-treed political battleground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, made the case to Republican National Committee members that Trump has two personalities: one in private and one onstage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When he’s out on the stage, when he’s talking about the kinds of things he’s talking about on the stump, he’s projecting an image that’s for that purpose,” Manafort said in a private briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll start to see more depth of the person, the real person. You’ll see a real different way,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Associated Press obtained a recording of the closed-door exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He gets it,” Manafort said of Trump’s need to moderate his personality. “The part that he’s been playing is evolving into the part that now you’ve been expecting, but he wasn’t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase. The negatives will come down. The image is going to change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The message was welcomed by some party officials but criticized by others who suggested it raised doubts about his authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s trying to moderate. He’s getting better,” said Ben Carson, a Trump ally who was part of the GOP’s front-runner’s RNC outreach team.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Trump’s top advisers were promising Republican leaders that the GOP front-runner would moderate his message, the candidate was telling voters he wasn’t ready to act presidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just don’t know if I want to do it yet,” Trump said during a raucous rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Thursday that was frequently interrupted by protesters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At some point, I’m going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored,” he said, predicting that the size of his crowds would dwindle if he dialed back his rhetoric.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was evidence of drama on the Democratic side as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prominent Southern Democrats urged Bernie Sanders to stop dismissing Hillary Clinton’s landslide primary wins across the South, where the front-runner’s popularity among non-whites has helped fuel her success.\n",

      "Sanders said the results in the South “distort reality” because they came from the country’s “most conservative region.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Fowler of South Carolina, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and other Clinton supporters told Sanders in a letter that “our national Democratic leaders” should “invest in our races and causes — to amplify our voices, not diminish them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet as Clinton’s grasp on the Democratic nomination tightens, Trump’s overwhelming Republican delegate lead has done little to calm concerns from GOP leaders, gathered at the resort for the party’s meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Trump continues to rail against “a rigged” nomination process, he sent Manafort and his newly hired political director, Rick Wiley, to help improve relationships with party officials at the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might not win some of these blue states, but you can make the Democrats spend money and time,” Wiley said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s team also signaled to RNC members a fresh willingness to dip into the New York real estate mogul’s personal fortune to fund his presidential bid, in addition to helping the national committee raise money, a promise that comes just as Trump launches his first big television advertising campaign in a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "His campaign reserved about $2 million worth of air time in soon-to-vote Pennsylvania and Indiana, advertising tracker Kantar Media’s CMAG shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s willing to spend what is necessary to finish this out. That’s a big statement from him,” Manafort said in the briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump is increasingly optimistic about his chances in five states holding primary contests Tuesday: Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. He is now the only Republican candidate who can possibly collect the 1,237-delegate majority needed to claim the nomination before the party’s July convention.\n",

      "Chief rival Ted Cruz hopes Trump will fall short of a nomination-clinching delegate majority so that he can turn enough delegates to his side at the convention to give him the prize.\n",

      "\n",
      "Speaking at a town-hall event on NBC’s “Today” show Thursday, Trump said North Carolina’s bathroom law has caused unnecessary strife and transgender people should be able to choose which bathroom to use.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cooper and McCrory won their respective March 15 primaries the week before the General Assembly held a special session to block a Charlotte City Council ordinance that extended protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people at hotels, restaurants and stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two are expected to run in one of the most expensive and competitive gubernatorial races this year, so every extra donation is important. National Democrats consider North Carolina their best chance to knock off a Republican incumbent. The two campaigns already have raised more than $13 million, with Cooper ahead in the money chase through the end of February.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticism of the law and McCrory has led to a federal lawsuit and vocal protests outside the governor’s mansion and on cable television news. Social conservatives are holding prayer vigils and rallies supporting McCrory and other Republicans, who say Charlotte crossed the line when the ordinance allowed transgender people to use the rest room aligned with their gender identity at public accommodations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both candidates “are going to try to raise the money from the red-hots,” said Gary Pearce, a longtime consultant in North Carolina Democratic politics. “That’s what anger is always a good motivator for — contributions on both sides.”\n",
      "\n",
      "McCrory has said he’s been unfairly treated by the national media and with an orchestrated campaign of misinformation about the law.\n",

      "“The White House attacked us. The ACLU sued us. And Attorney General Cooper won’t try to stop them from stripping the basic expectation of privacy and safety North Carolinians have when they or their children use the restroom,” said a McCrory campaign email signed by campaign manager Russell Peck while asking for $25.\n",

      "The state law went further by preventing others counties and cities from enforcing similar rules and requiring public schools and universities and government agencies to limit multistall bathrooms to people of the same biological sex only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooper has said McCrory inserted discrimination into state law and created a “national embarrassment” that will lose the state jobs. More than 130 corporate executives — the latest include those from General Electric Co., Oracle and LabCorp.— have signed a letter demanding McCrory seek the law’s repeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Together, we can take a stand against this law. Together, we can make our voices heard and say we won’t stand for bigotry and discrimination in North Carolina,” said the email fundraising plea, signed simply, “Roy.”\n",

      "The state Democratic Party and state Senate leader Phil Berger also have tapped into anger about or defense of the ordinance with their own email and online donation pleas.\n",

      "\n",
      "Republican consultant Dee Stewart, who is not working in the gubernatorial race, said he expects both candidates will benefit but the issue will motivate “low-dollar donors” more. He cautioned the shelf life of raising money off the law is limited and gubernatorial candidates will move to the next big thing that gets media attention.\n",

      "http://reuters1618-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/143352364582/obama-ramps-up-special-forces-mission-in-syria\n",
      "By Roberta Rampton HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - President Barack Obama announced on Monday the biggest expansion of U.S. ground troops in Syria since the civil war there began, saying he would dispatch 250 special forces soldiers to help local militia to build on successes against Islamic State. The new deployment increases U.S. forces in Syria six-fold to about 300. While the total U.S. ground force is still small by comparison to other American deployments, defense experts said it could help shift the momentum in Syria by giving more Syrian fighters on the ground access to U.S. close air support. Obama said the move followed victories that clawed back territory from Islamic State. “Given the success, I’ve approved the deployment of up to 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including special forces, to keep up this momentum,” Obama said in a speech in the German city of Hanover, the last stop on a foreign tour that has taken him to Saudi Arabia and Britain. “They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces as they continue to drive ISIL back,” he added, using an acronym for Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh. The U.S. military has led an air campaign against Islamic State since 2014 in both Iraq and Syria, but the campaign’s effectiveness in Syria has been limited by a lack of allies on the ground in a country where a complex, multi-sided civil war has raged for five years. Russia launched its own air campaign in Syria last year, which has been more effective because it is closely coordinated with the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is Moscow’s ally but a foe of the United States. CLOSE AIR SUPPORT Washington’s main allies on the ground have been a Kurdish force known as the YPG, who wrested control of much of the Turkish-Syrian border from Islamic State. However, the alliance has been constrained because U.S. ally Turkey is deeply hostile to the YPG. “Presumably these are going to assist our Kurdish YPG friends to widen and deepen their offensive against IS in northeastern Syria,” Tim Ripley, defense analyst and writer for IHS Janes Defence Weekly magazine, said of the extra special forces. “The more people you have, the more militia groups can have close air support that makes them more effective so they can advance in more areas,” Ripley said. But Washington would still have to take a political decision to help the Kurds despite Turkish objections. Kurdish advances have largely stopped since February, with Turkey opposed to the Kurds taking more territory. “The real question has to be: are they going to let the Kurdish YPG forces actually go and attack and capture some territory? This is something the Americans have not been happy about because when the YPG forces attack and capture territory, it tends to anger the president of Turkey,“ Ripley said. The Syria Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed coalition set up in October to unite the Kurdish YPG and some Arab allies, welcomed Obama’s announcement but still wanted more help. \"Any support they offer is positive but we hope there will be greater support,” SDF spokesman Talal Silo said. “So far we have been supplied only with ammunition, and we were hoping to be supplied with military hardware.” The HNC umbrella opposition, which represents groups opposed to Assad but not the Kurds, also welcomed U.S. forces helping rid Syria of the Islamic State “scourge”, but said Washington should do more to fight against Assad. “Syria will not be free of terrorism until we see the end of the Assad regime’s reign of terror. We need help in freeing our country from Assad as well as from Daesh,” spokesman Salem al-Meslet said in a statement. If the Kurds are given the green light to advance with American air support, the main short-term objective could be sealing off the last stretch of the border that is not held by the Kurds or the government, west of the Euphrates river. That would deny Islamic State access to the outside world, but would infuriate Turkey which regards the border as the main access route for other Sunni Muslim rebel groups it supports against Assad, and for aid to civilians in rebel areas. THE RACE FOR RAQQA U.S. special forces teams providing close air support could ultimately help the Kurds advance on Raqqa, Islamic State’s main Syrian stronghold and de facto capital. “This places them in another quandary. Do they coordinate their attack on Raqqa with the Syrian army and the Russian air force, who are … advancing on Raqqa? … The question is who’s going to get there first,” Ripley said. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel sitting in the audience, Obama also urged Europe and NATO allies to do more in the fight against Islamic State. The group controls the cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria and a swathe of territory in between, and has proven a potent threat abroad, claiming responsibility for major attacks in Paris in November and Brussels in March. “Even as European countries make important contributions against ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more,” Obama said ahead of talks with Merkel and the leaders of Britain, France and Italy. European countries have mostly contributed only small numbers of aircraft to the U.S.-led mission targeting Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. Obama pledged to wind down wars in the Middle East when he was first elected in 2008. But in the latter part of his presidency he has found it necessary to keep troops in Afghanistan, return them to Iraq and send them to Syria, where the five-year civil war has killed at least 250,000 people. In Iraq, Islamic State has been forced back since December when it lost Ramadi, capital of the western province of Anbar. In Syria, jihadist fighters have been pushed from the city of Palmyra by Russian-backed Syrian government forces. TALKS IN MELTDOWN, TRUCE IN TATTERS But Washington’s lack of allies on the ground has meant its role in Syria has been circumscribed. The sudden entry of Moscow into the conflict last year tipped the balance of power in favor of Assad against a range of rebel groups supported by Turkey, other Arab states and the West including Washington. Washington and Moscow sponsored a ceasefire between most of the main warring parties since February, which allowed the first peace talks involving Assad’s government and many of his foes to begin last month. However, those talks appear close to collapse, with the main opposition delegation having suspended its participation last week, and the ceasefire is largely in tatters. Islamic State is excluded from the ceasefire. Fighting has increased in recent days near Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city, now split between rebel and government zones. A monitoring group said 60 people had been killed there in three days of intense fighting, including civilians killed by rebel shelling and government air strikes. The Syrian government’s negotiator at the Geneva talks said a bomb hit a hospital near a Shi'ite shrine near Damascus, killing many innocent people and proving the government’s enemies were terrorists.

      "FLINT, Mich. (AP) — Showing support for the beleaguered residents of Flint, Michigan, President Barack Obama drank filtered city water on Wednesday to show that it is again safe following a lead-contamination crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "After officials briefed Obama on the federal government’s response to the contamination, a reporter asked if he would drink the water in a glass on the table. The president said he usually avoids publicity stunts. But he took a drink, saying he wanted to show the water must be safe if he’s drinking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This used a filter,” Obama said of the water. “The water around this table was Flint water and it just confirms what we know scientifically, which is, if you’re using a filter, if you’re installing it, then Flint water at this point is drinkable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in mid-January and ordered federal aid to supplement the state and local response. At that point, however, the crisis was in full bloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took several months for the nation to focus on the beaten-down city’s plight, raising questions about how race and poverty influenced decisions that led to the tainted water supply and the beleaguered response once problems surfaced. More than 40 percent of Flint residents live in poverty and more than half are black.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama, making his first visit to the city since the crisis began, said the discussion during the briefing underscored that local, state and federal officials must ensure that residents are healthy and have safe water to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s time for politics. There’s time for turf battles. This is not one of them,” Obama said. “All of us need to keep our eyes on the ball even when the cameras go away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the water crisis stemmed from a broader issues, the hard times and neglect that had gripped Flint long ago. He said the focus now must be on rebuilding and moving the city “in a better direction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama also urged residents to use the water filters that are being provided free of charge, and for parents to have their children examined for lead in their bloodstreams. He also pressed people to let the taps run for five minutes every day to flush out any contaminants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an effort to save money, the city, while under state management, began drawing its water from the Flint River in April 2014. Despite complaints from residents about the smell and taste and health problems, city leaders insisted the water was safe. However, doctors reported last September that the blood of children contained high levels of lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The source of the city’s water was subsequently switched back to Detroit, but the lead problem still is not fully solved, and people are drinking filtered or bottled water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political and legal fallout is ongoing. An independent commission appointed by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder determined the state was primarily responsible for the water contamination in Flint, and he issued an apology. The Obama administration’s response, through the Environmental Protection Agency, has also come under criticism from Snyder and some in Congress who say the EPA didn’t move with necessary urgency upon hearing of problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told Congress that, while staff repeatedly urged the state to address the lack of corrosion controls, “we missed the opportunity late last summer to quickly get EPA’s concerns on the public’s radar screen.” An inspector general is investigating the EPA’s response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House announced Obama’s visit by posting a letter he wrote to 8-year-old Flint resident Mari Copeny, known locally as “Little Miss Flint,” who had asked to meet the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress is also grappling with how to help Flint, but progress has been slow. A Senate committee last week approved a $220 million aid package as part of a broader bill that would authorize nearly $4.8 billion for water-related projects around the country. The bill could come up for a Senate vote in May.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course, the real reason Sanders does better in exit polling than actual votes is that Sanders supporters will not shut up about Bernie Sanders, so of course they’re eager to talk to exit pollsters. That, not a national conspiracy among county election administrators to rig the system for Hillary Clinton, is what’s at play.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Robbins’ nutty conspiracy mongering starts to seem sensible if you place yourself in the mindset of a Sanders supporter, as laid out by Sanders himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, Sanders believes that if voters were truly paying attention to the issues and uninfluenced by special interests, then more than 90% of people would support his agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that is really true, then there can be only three possible reasons Sanders is losing: Voters are ignorant, they’ve been bought off, or they actually are voting for him and the machines are rigged. If you honestly believed that, then why wouldn’t you approach Sanders’ opponents as ignorant and corrupt?\n",
      "\n",
      "Robbins — who, in fairness, was very good in “The Shawshank Redemption” — managed to indulge in the vote-rigging and -buying aspects of this theory in just the last few hours. After tweeting the “rigged” theory, some Twitter users responded to say that he was wrong.\n",

It might seem odd that Clinton allies would bother paying off a Twitter user with just 46 followers — but then, choosing to oppose Bernie Sanders is so weird that it’s hard to understand how else it would happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third mode of Sanders supporter engagement with disagreement is condescension: If you weren’t paid off and your vote wasn’t stolen from you, then maybe you’re just too ill-informed to realize Sanders is the candidate you actually want.\n",

      "N.W.A.’s rough-hewn tales tilted the balance toward West Coast rap in the late 1980s on songs like “F— the Police,” “Boyz-N-The Hood” and “Straight Outta Compton.” Following the act’s breakup, Dr. Dre became one of music’s most in-demand producers and a billionaire with a high-tech headphone company. Ice Cube moves between music and a successful acting career.\n",

      "Ice Cube turned to Dr. Dre, thanking him for letting him hang around and make music with him as a 15-year-year old boy. Then he caught himself: “Stay in school, kids, God damn it,” he said to the audience’s laughter.\n",

In my heart, I am bewildered that they are so late in getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The band was without one of its founding members, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who stayed away because current members wouldn’t agree to play with him. But the inductees regarded him warmly in their speeches and paid tribute musically — performing “Smoke on the Water” with the signature riff that the guitarist came up with.\n",

      "Superstar DJ Calvin Harris was supposedly the Sunday headliner at Indio, California’s Coachella music festival this past weekend, but his uninspired closing show on the main stage was a disappointment, really nothing different from anything you’d see at one of his Vegas weekend megaclub residencies. Instead, the day – and really, the entire festival – belonged to elusive and reclusive pop provocateur Sia, whose ambitious hour-long concert, which she co-directed with Daniel Askill, was one of the greatest moments in Coachella’s 17-year history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, to call Sia’s set a “concert” does it a massive injustice. This was theater, challenging the very notions of what a live festival experience can be. To borrow a phrase from Sia’s recently released sixth album, this was acting. This was performance art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sia herself appeared onstage looking like a living art installation, her signature bow-topped, two-toned bob wig curtaining her entire face as she posed atop a white cube in a billowing ruffled gown – a breakaway garment that then “gave birth” to a litter of contemporary dancers. And that was just during the first verse of opening number “Alive.” From that stunning moment onward, spectators knew they were not witnessing a typical Coachella show. Sia may have belted, “I’m still breathing,” but all concertgoers on the field were collectively holding their breath – in awe, in confusion, or a combination of the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHOTOS: On the Scene at Coachella 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of Sia’s 13 songs Sunday night was a performance art piece unto itself, featuring avant choreography by Ryan Heffington, dramatically angst-y plotlines, and visuals that were much trippier than any of the screensaver-like video-screen graphics that would later run in loops during Harris’s DJ set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of Sia’s video projections, in fact, starred her 2015 Grammys collaborator Kristen Wiig, actors Paul Dano and Gaby Hoffman, comic Tig Notaro, and astonishingly talented Sia muse/Dance Moms prodigy Maddie Ziegler (all wearing Sia wigs, of course) – their pre-taped skits impressively and impeccably synched with the professional dancers’ live routines taking place on the stage below. Even in a festival weekend that boasted surprise appearances by Kanye West, Kesha, AC/DC’s Angus Young, Lorde, Sam Smith, and three-fifths of N.W.A, these cameos stood out as incredibly special.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHOTOS: Coachella Surprise Guests Over the Years\n",
      "\n",
      "Dano portrayed a miserable corporate drone stuck in customer-service purgatory during “Bird Set Free” and a couple between-song vignettes. Wiig, completely not in wacky comedienne mode, sobbed maniacally while sitting in a white suit on a metal chair, then interpretive-danced in a simulated rainstorm during “One Million Bullets.” Sia’s performance of Rihanna’s “Diamonds” (which Sia co-wrote) featured a virtual Notaro wearing bedazzled Michael Jackson gloves and staring in wonderment at light beams shooting from her palms. Ziegler, making a great case for her recent hiring as a So You Think You Can Dance judge, appeared in six astonishing musical numbers. Other striking moments included a dancer in an oversized David Byrne-circa-Stop Making Sense suit with claw-like epaulets, and an emotional fight routine between two mismatched-height performers wearing crude animal heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazingly, none of this upstaged Sia’s otherworldly vocals on soaring, stratospheric songs like “Chandelier,” “Big Girls Cry,” and David Guetta’s “Titanium,” despite the fact that she remained in the background – obscured by shadows, her wig, and her giant Hello Kitty hair-bow – throughout her set.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that triumph, any other performance was bound to be a letdown, but Harris’s lazy set (which started 15 minutes late) consisted of just one missed opportunity after another. Never mind that his girlfriend Taylor Swift stayed put in the crowd and didn’t hop onstage for a hoped-for surprise love duet (if there was any time or place for them to make their live debut as a performing power couple, this would have been it); considering Harris’s many A-list collaborators over the years, the DJ could have pulled a Pharrell/Dr. Dre and filled his set with buzzy cameos (or even some holograms). But instead, Ellie Goulding (who actually played Coachella on Friday) was a no-show while he spun “I Need Your Love,” “Outside,” and “How Deep Is Your Love,” as was Florence Welch on “Sweet Nothing.” And a rumored HAIM appearance never materialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big Sean did show up for “Open Wide” (and his own “I Don’t F— With You”), but that didn’t happen until halfway through Harris’s set, at which point much momentum was already lost. And yes, Rihanna did appear in the flesh to perform her smash hit “We Found Love” (which Harris wrote), but even that was underwhelming, since she pretty much half-sang over the canned track – plus this was really just a reprise of her “We Found Love” Calvin/Coachella cameo from 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris’s set ended strongly enough with British singer John Newman coming out for “Blame,” but that couldn’t make up for Harris wasting most of his valuable stage time spinning obvious selections like Daft Punk’s “One More Time,” the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ “Heads Will Roll,” and Adele’s “Hello.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Incidentally, the above-mentioned Taylor Swift garnered a lot of press this weekend just for attending Coachella with her squad and posting a few desert Instagrams of her new platinum ‘do, but Swift and Harris were not Coachella’s cutest couple this year. That honor belonged to gruff country troubadour Chris Stapleton and his singer-songwriter wife Morgane, whose sizable turnout of enthusiastic millennials proved that not everyone flocks to Coachella these days just for Harris-esque EDM. Backed by a minimalist (and obviously all-analog) band, the lovey-dovey Stapletons – quite possibly the Johnny and June of our time – charmed the crowd as they serenaded each other on “You Are My Sunshine” and “Tennessee Whiskey,” staring deeply into each other’s starry eyes. (“She’s the love of my life… Honey, I’m so in love with you,” Chris crooned, as the audience swooned.) Mr. Stapleton’s perfect sundown show at an otherwise rock-, dance-, and indie-centric festival was evidence of his rare wide-ranging appeal – but it’s likely that he and his missus will graduate from the intimate Gobi Tent to a larger stage when they pull double-duty and return to the same Empire Polo Field grounds in two weeks, for the country music Stagecoach festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another highlight of Coachella weekend one’s final day was the early evening main stage set by the 1975, fronted by Swift’s once-rumored love interest, the charismatic and outlandish Matt Healy. Classy and wonderfully pretentious Brit gent that he is, Healy casually sipped red wine from a real glass goblet onstage throughout his Manchester band’s set of pastel-suited, saxophone-embellished funk-pop (think Scritti Politti, INXS, Go West… more 1985 than 1975), then got philosophical, lecturing privileged concertgoers about the festival’s “superficial atmosphere” on this, the kickoff date of the 1975’s U.S. tour. “We’re all free here, and a lot of people aren’t free,” he stated, “and if we’re gonna be free, let’s do it in honor of people who aren't… because I f—ing love it here [in America], but we are so f—ing lucky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Coachella returns to Indio next weekend for an encore, featuring the same lineup but probably including some new cameos and surprises. Will Sia be able to top herself? Will Calvin Harris benefit from a desert do-over? Watch this space.\n",

      "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, once one of the country’s most powerful politicians, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in federal prison for a financial crime related to sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Durkin called Hastert a serial sex abuser in handing down the sentence, which was longer than the zero to six months recommended by federal prosecutors. Durkin said the sentence would have been even longer if it weren’t for Hastert’s age, 74, and poor health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frail and clinging to a walker, Hastert apologized for sexually abusing boys when he was a teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry to those I hurt and misled. I wanted to apologize for the boys I mistreated,” Hastert told Durkin at the two-hour sentencing hearing in federal court in Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge asked him if he acknowledged sexual abuse of his victims and Hastert said he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastert, the longest-serving Republican House speaker in history and a successful international lobbyist who was earning $75,000 a month, pleaded guilty last October to the crime of structuring. That involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "He needed the cash after he reached a secret agreement with one of his five sexual abuse victims to pay him $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge said that even though Hastert could not be charged with sex abuse because the statute of limitations had run out, he could take the conduct into consideration at sentencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some conduct is unforgivable no matter how old it is. The abuse was 40 years ago but the damage lasts today,” Durkin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastert’s defense had asked for a probation-only sentence, arguing that his shame and humiliation were punishment enough. His portrait has been removed from the Capitol, the seat of the U.S. Congress, and his alma mater Wheaton College stripped his name from a public policy center.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing is more stunning than having the words ‘serial child molester’ and 'speaker of the house’ in the same sentence,” Durkin acknowledged. But he said that an extremely aggravating factor in the sentencing was that Hastert lied to federal agents about the money and falsely claimed that the victim was extorting him. He said Hastert must serve two years of probation and go through sex-offender treatment after release, and also pay a $250,000 fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scott Cross, 53, one of Hastert’s victims, and Jolene Burdge, the sister of another victim who is deceased, both spoke during the hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be a coward, Mr. Hastert,” Burdge said. “Tell the truth. What you did wasn’t misconduct. It was sexual abuse of a minor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross, the first victim to ever speak publicly about the abuse, choked up as he described how Hastert molested him in the wrestling locker room in 1972.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a 17-year-old boy I was devastated,” he told the judge. “I tried to figure out why Coach Hastert had singled me out. I felt very alone and tremendously embarrassed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastert, a conservative who trumpeted his honesty and small-town values when he was in Washington, D.C., said he did not contest Cross’s statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his defense said the former politician had forgotten the incident from 1972 and had even approached Cross’s older brother, Tom Cross, former Illinois House Republican leader, and asked him to write a letter of support to the judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sex abuse victim who received money from Hastert has not been named publicly. On Monday, using the name James Doe, he sued Hastert for $1.8 million, saying he had received only $1.7 million of the promised compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastert had been out on bail pending sentencing. When there is room for him, he will report to a federal prison where he can get medical treatment after suffering a life-threatening blood infection last year.\n",

Prince had postponed concerts in Atlanta citing an illness but rescheduled them and performed there April 14.\n",

      "“People use medication. The question is, are you on meds in a dangerous way?” he said.\n",

      "McMillan also said Prince was in great spirits.\n",

      "Introduced alongside a slew of changes to the $5 and $10 notes as well, the redesign gives the Treasury “a chance to open the aperture to reflect more of America’s history,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new $10 bill will add images of five female leaders of the women’s suffrage movement, including Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to the back, while keeping founding father Alexander Hamilton on the front.\n",

      "The reverse of a new $5 note will show former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., officials said. Former President Abraham Lincoln will remain on the front.\n",

      "Lew said the designs should be unveiled by 2020 and go into circulation “as quickly as possible,” although he declined to say when. He said the $10 bill was scheduled to go out first, citing security needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-awaited decision to replace the seventh president of the United States with Tubman followed months of outreach by the Treasury regarding which woman should be featured on a bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate began when the Treasury announced plans in June to feature a woman on the $10 note, prompted partly by a young girl’s letter to President Barack Obama that criticized the lack of women on U.S. currency and a social media campaign last year called “Women on 20s.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812’s Battle of New Orleans, was president from 1829-1837. But he has been criticized for his treatment of American Indians and ownership of slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "After considering hundreds of candidates, Lew said Tubman was chosen for her leadership and work helping others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the essential story of American democracy about how one person who grew up in slavery, never had the benefit of learning how to read or write, could change the course of history,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman grew up working on a Maryland plantation and escaped in her late 20s. She returned to the South to help hundreds of black slaves to freedom and worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women have not been depicted on U.S. bills since Martha Washington, who was on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Pocahontas, who was in a group picture on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.\n",

This year, in its final season, Idol searched for a “Kelly Clarkson bookend.” And this week – on a nostalgic, throwback-Thursday finale featuring dozens of alumni who’ve competed in the years in between – the show came full circle and crowned a winner worthy of the Kelly legacy.\n",

Then he proved he had a great all-American work ethic, as well as talent, when he bravely soldiered through Hollywood Week while battling a case of full-blown mono (it’s crazy to imagine how this season might’ve panned out if Trent had followed doctor’s orders and quit the show). But it really wasn’t until top four week, when he exquisitely belted Sia’s “Chandelier” – one of the greatest Idol performances of all time – that Trent truly became a Season 15 frontrunner.\n",

      "But La’Porsha should be incredibly proud of her runner-up status.

This week, American Idol ended on a literal and figurative high note.

      "\n",
      "I was at the Crazy Horse [Steak House & Saloon, in Santa Ana, Calif.] in the early ‘90s. It’s the first time I’d seen Haggard play live. I’m crying like a baby, standing in the back shadows. He says, “I hear Garth Brooks is in the audience tonight.” And my whole throat just tightened up. I was like, “Please, I’ll never make it. I’ll just bawl like a baby.” He said, “I’d love for him and come up here and sing, but the truth is I got enough of my own songs to sing tonight.” And the place laughed and I started laughing through my tears and he went into something like “Okie From Muskogee.” It was so perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met him that night. It was surreal. You’re looking in the eyes of the guy you’d stared at [on] his album covers forever. It was cool. I actually was proud of myself that I handled it better than I did meeting [George] Jones. I met Jones first and I think how much I embarrassed myself around Jones from just uncontrollably crying and how much I embarrassed Jones by doing it. I think that kind of helped me with Haggard. [I told him] how much he meant to my dad (chokes up). He got my dad through a lot of hard times. If you’re going to lead a generation through some hard times, it’s going to be because you’ve gone through hard times yourself.\n",

      "Haggard and I talked on the phone. I so enjoyed those talks because it helped me in my career. The last time I talked to Haggard was about [2014’s Working Man’s Poet: A Tribute to Merle Haggard], and he was very sweet. He heard I had cut “Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down” [for Brooks’ 2013 Blame It All On My Roots: Five Decades Of Influences box set]. He said, “Can I have that [recording for the tribute album]?” I reminded him, “Merle, understand, I know every song you’ve ever done. Every song. Every album cut. Everything. Anything you want done on this, please let me know.” He said, “Nope. That way I don’t trouble you and I get what I need.” He was a very common sense guy, which I loved. That was Haggard. He wouldn’t take up a lot of time. He’d just say what he meant, meant what he said and go on. I cherish those moments with him.\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Billy Paul, a jazz and soul singer best known for the No. 1 hit ballad and “Philadelphia Soul” classic “Me and Mrs. Jones,” died Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul, whose career spanned for more than 60 years, died at his home in Blackwood, New Jersey, his co-manager, Beverly Gay, told The Associated Press. Paul, 80, had been diagnosed recently with pancreatic cancer, Gay said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known by his beard and large glasses, Paul was one of many singers who found success with the writing and producing team of Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, whose Philadelphia International Records also released music by the O'Jays, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, and Lou Rawls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me and Mrs. Jones” was an extramarital confession and a characteristic Gamble and Huff production, setting Paul’s thick tenor against a lush and sensuous arrangement. Many fans best remember the moment when Paul’s otherwise subtle vocals jump as they reach the title words, stretching out “Me” and “And” into multiple syllables and repeating “Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones.” (Paul himself was married to the same woman for decades).\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul’s voice made him “one of the great artists to come out of Philly and to be celebrated worldwide,” Gamble and Huff said in a statement late Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our proudest moment with Billy was the recording of the salacious smash ‘Me and Mrs. Jones.’ In our view, it is one of the greatest love songs ever recorded,” they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The song was one of the top singles of 1972 and brought Paul a Grammy the following year for best male rhythm ‘n blues performance, with runners-up including Ray Charles and Curtis Mayfield. Paul remained identified with the song for the rest of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul continued to perform live until he fell ill and his manager said he had been lining up numerous appearances at the time of his death. Among his favorites in concert was a cover of Prince’s “Purple Rain.” (Prince died last Thursday).\n",
      "\n",
      "He was born Paul Williams but later agreed to his manager’s suggestion that he change his name to Billy Paul to avoid confusion with songwriter Paul Williams and other musicians with the same name. A Philadelphia native, he sang much his life, performing with such jazz stars as Charlie Parker and Dinah Washington and being featured on a handful of singles while still in his teens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul was drafted into the military in his early 20s, and found himself on the same base in Germany with a couple of famous show business names, Elvis Presley and Gary Crosby, Bing Crosby’s son.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We said we’re going to start a band, so we didn’t have to do any hard work in the service,” he told bluesandsoul.com in 2015. “We tried to get Elvis to join but he wanted to be a jeep driver. So me and Gary Crosby, we started it and called ourselves the Jazz Blues Symphony Band.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beatles had inspired him to incorporate more rhythm 'n blues into his singing and he had found a new home for his recordings after meeting Gamble at a Philadelphia music shop. His early albums with Gamble and Huff, including “Ebony Woman” and “Going East,” sold modestly, before “Me and Mrs. Jones” briefly made him a superstar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul faced numerous obstacles following his biggest hit. Radio stations resisted his more socially conscious follow-up song, “Am I Black Enough for You” and the Rev. Jesse Jackson was among those who objected to the explicit “Let’s Make a Baby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, Paul sued Gamble and Huff and other industry officials over unpaid royalties and was awarded $500,000 by a Los Angeles jury in 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul is survived by his wife, Blanche Williams, with whom he had two children. Although he endured many difficult moments with Gamble and Huff, he would look back on those years as a lost golden age.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I was on the tour bus, sleeping, and [the other queens] woke me up and said I had to sing ‘Purple Rain’ that night, saying, ‘Prince just died!’ I was in shock. But [show hostess] Michelle Visage said, ‘It’s not even a question, girl. You’re doing it,’” Adore tells Yahoo Music’s Reality Rocks.\n",

      "That night, the Artist Formerly Known as Danny Noriega from American Idol put on some purple lipstick and a raincoat, and belted a simple, emotional rendition of Prince’s classic ballad at the Regency Ballroom in front of a glowing purple neon outline of a bleeding heart; she reprised the powerful, crowd-pleasing number the following night at Anaheim’s Grove venue. “It’s my favorite song to sing, it really is,” she says. “It’s a song I’ve known since I was a baby. It’s like an ‘I Will Always Love You’ kind of jam… The song is so iconic. It’s cool to see the older fans have mad respect [for my version], since the song’s before my time.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Reveals Adore: “The song originally spoke to me in a really personal way, even before Prince dying. That whole genre and time of music just reminds me of my dad [who passed away in 2014]. My dad always said, ‘There’s only a few great ones,’ and Prince was definitely one of the greats. Then ‘Purple Rain’ took on new meaning when I had broken up with my ex and I did a show in his hometown and sang it. It was just a really crazy moment, and that’s always a memory when I’m singing it as well. Now it has even more meaning, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Purple Rain” is not the first salute to a recently deceased rock legend during this year’s BOTS tour: On select dates, Season 4 winner Sharon Needles, in a vibrant orange Ziggy Stardust wig and one-shouldered onesie, has dramatically performed David Bowie’s “Space Oddity.” Prince and Bowie obviously have more in common than being two incredibly talented icons who left us too soon this year: Both flamboyant artists daringly played with androgyny, gender roles, and theatricality, which makes their material perfect fare for a drag revue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was just the concept of beauty, and color. Nothing was fear-driven,” says Adore of the ‘70s/’80s era in which Prince and Bowie ruled. “Everything was so experimental – the music as well as the looks. They added so many sounds to their songs, adding and adding and adding, and the result were these brilliant masterpieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Adore’s opinion on Prince’s imagery specifically, she says, “He was amazing, visually beautiful to look at,” and says her all-time favorite Prince look is “just him naked, in a thong, with that blown-out, feathered, Farrah Fawcett hair. It’s just stunning. There’s something so simple about it, but so iconic. Every time I think of the greatness of Prince, that era is in my mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Adore is uncertain if “Purple Rain” will remain a staple of her set on the remaining 2016 BOTS tourdates; when asked if there’s any other Prince cover she might consider, she semi-jokes, “Probably ‘Erotic City’ – in a thong! That’d be awesome. But I don’t think I have the guts.”\n",

      "ABC is counting on former football player Michael Strahan to help it gain new ground in TV’s ever-intensifying morning-news wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strahan, who has become a near-ubiquitous TV presence with his stints as a commentator for Fox Sports’ football coverage, the host of a new kid-award franchise on Nickelodeon, and, in recent years, an energizing force on the Disney-syndicated morning program Live! With Kelly and Michael, will join ABC’s Good Morning America on a full-time basis starting in September, ABC said Tuesday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Michael has been a stellar addition to the broadcast. Over the past two years on GMA, he’s proven to be a tireless and versatile broadcaster with an incredible ability to connect with people, from veterans to American pop culture icons and newsmakers,” said James Goldston, president of ABC News, in a memo to staff sent this morning. “He will end a four year run as Kelly Ripa’s co-host on ‘Live!,’ where he has honed his skills as an interviewer with genuine warmth and a quick wit. At GMA, he’ll now have even more opportunities to tell stories that inspire, inform and empower people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strahan joins the GMA team at a critical time. In 2012, the program snatched ratings victory from NBC’s Today for the first time in 16 years, and moved on to become the nation’s most-watched morning program. In recent months, however, it has ceded ground to its NBC rival, which has for months won more of the viewers for which advertisers in news programming pay – people between 25 and 54. Indeed, both programs have been losing viewers in recent months. For the week ending April 8, Good Morning America saw its overall viewership fall by 7%, while the 25-to-54 audience fell 19%. At NBC, overall viewership for Today slipped 2% in the same time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Strahan, ABC has an energetic and winning personality whose appeal has only grown in recent years. Live ranks number one among entertainment daytime talk shows among households and ties for first among women between 25 and 54. The show is second among syndicated talk shows, losing only to Dr. Phil. Live was recently renewed through 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strahan has been a twice-a-week presence on Good Morning America over the past two years, lending a different sort of energy to the broadcast, which has for years depended regularly on TV-news personnel ranging from Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson to Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer and George Stephanpoulos. In recent weeks, GMA has appeared to take a newsier bent, opening not with its entire crew greeting viewers, but with a tighter focus on Roberts (news anchor Amy Robach in her absence) and Stephanpoulous. Spencer has then joined the pair after the first quarter hour.\n",

      "An Australian man long rumored to be associated with the digital currency Bitcoin has publicly identified himself as its creator, a claim that would end one of the biggest mysteries in the tech world.\n",
      "\n",
      "BBC News said Monday that Craig Wright told the media outlet he is the man previously known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The computer scientist, inventor and academic said he launched the currency in 2009 with the help of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright made similar claims to the Economist magazine, which said on its website it still has “nagging” questions about Wright’s claim. He also asserted his role in a lengthy blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "The founder’s identity has been shrouded in uncertainty, and the media’s inability to pinpoint the person responsible has led to a series of investigations. Last year, some reports claimed Wright was the founder and had used a false name to mask his identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright told the BBC he had decided to make his identity known to stop the spread of “misinformation” about Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t take the decision lightly to make my identity public and I want to be clear that I’m doing this because I care so passionately about my work and also to dispel any negative myths and fears,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright said he believes that Bitcoin and blockchain, the technical innovation that makes the currency possible, “can change the world for the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that he would now be able to release his research and academic work to help people understand the potential of Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin is designed for secure financial transactions that require no central authority — no banks, no government regulators. That makes it attractive to off-the-grid types such as libertarians, people who want to evade tax authorities, and criminals, even though Bitcoin doesn’t guarantee anonymity, since it documents every transaction in a public forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the BBC, Wright supported his claim to being the founder by signing digital messages using cryptographic keys used during the early days of Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Wright is the founder, he is likely a very wealthy person. The person going by the pseudonym Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about 1 million Bitcoins, which would be worth about $450 million if converted to cash, the BBC says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, which says it helps support the use of the currency, told the BBC he is convinced that Wright is who he claims to be and is responsible for a brilliant achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunt for Bitcoin’s founder had become a mission for some journalists. Attention focused for a time on a Finnish sociologist, a Japanese math whiz and a Japanese-American engineer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December, the technology magazine Wired and the website Gizmodo both published lengthy investigations based on documents and emails that concluded Wright was probably the man behind the pseudonym. He was living in an upscale suburb of Sydney at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reports were circumstantial and contained no proof. But Wright’s new statements, and his use of Nakamoto’s own encrypted signature, known as a PGP key, may have confirmed his role.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also spoke to GQ magazine and the London Review of Books.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings, published in the journal Obesity, tracked 14 of the show’s contestants for six years after the conclusion of the eighth season. The New York Times highlighted some of the dramatic and disheartening numbers.\n",

      "Winner Danny Cahill dropped from 430 pounds to 191; he has since gained back 100. Dina Mercado went from a preshow weight of 248 pounds all the way down to 173.5 pounds when the show ended; she’s now 205.9 pounds.

At the beginning of the show, although all the contestants were overweight, they had average resting heart rates for their sizes. At the end of the show, after their extreme diets, their metabolisms had slowed to a crawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “frightening and amazing” results\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not uncommon to have a slow metabolism just after significant weight loss, so researchers weren’t alarmed to see incredibly low BMRs just after the show. They were, however, shocked when the contestants’ metabolisms failed to adjust to their new, lower weights. The BMRs actually just kept getting worse, and the weight came flooding back.\n",

      "Cahill burns 800 fewer calories than average for a man his size, while Algaier’s BMR is 458 calories less than expected for his weight. Mercado now burns 437.9 fewer calories than a woman her size. “It is frightening and amazing,” Kevin Hall, the study’s lead author and a metabolic expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, told the New York Times of such dramatic results. “I am just blown away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to compare other weight-loss programs with the extremes of The Biggest Loser, says Reshmi Srinath, MD, an assistant professor of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, these results do confirm that universal truth about weight loss — in a big way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we shed pounds, our bodies fight hard to reapply them. “Multiple mediators act at the level of the hypothalamus to suppress our metabolic rate and promote weight regain,” Srinath tells Yahoo Beauty. “This study emphasizes just how challenging it is to lose weight and maintain the weight loss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only are we fighting our lower metabolisms with weight loss, but we’re fighting hormone fluctuations that would generally help bodies remain at a set weight, says Holly Lofton, MD, an assistant professor of medicine and the director of medical weight management program at NYU Langone Medical Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spikes and drops in hormone levels cause massive cravings, Lofton tells Yahoo Beauty. “The levels of appetite-reducing hormones like leptin, which researchers measured in the study, along with amylin, insulin, and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1), decrease after a loss of just 5 to 10 percent of body weight,” she says. “At the same time, the opposite happens with appetite-inducing hormones, like ghrelin, which grow in strength when you lose weight. These hormones are a big component of why it’s so hard to keep weight off.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Experts stress that this study is not a reason to believe you are doomed to be overweight for life, or that no weight-loss programs are effective. Researchers do need to keep examining potential avenues for extended weight maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Lofton thinks it’s important to understand phenomena happening in your body. “I always make patients aware,” she explains. “Inevitably, if they put some weight back on, they’ll think they have no willpower or that they’re cheating on their programs. So I let them know that they’re in a vulnerable state for weight regain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lofton also suggests becoming intimately familiar with your personal BMR. Like the contestants in the study, who were dramatically far from averages, you cannot guess your own number based on a simple calculation. “You can sometimes get a reading at the gym or, if not, at a doctor who deals with weight loss,” she says. “It is both age-specific and you-specific.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep the weight off, Lofton has patients eat to their BMR in net calories — so if you have a resting metabolism of 1,500 calories and burn 300 through exercise, you can eat 1,800 calories a day. If this is not a sustainable number of calories, or the patient is having trouble with regain, Lofton says that medical management is useful, and there are medications that can help prevent the pounds from coming back. (See your doctor for help with this.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Srinath says that once you enter maintenance mode, you still need to keep the mindset that you are on a regimen. Stay the course with a healthy diet and exercise, and avoid indulging or slacking as a prize for reaching your goal weight. “Because the resting metabolism slows as we lose weight, any extra calories do add up,” she says. “Exercise also plays a crucial role in helping to raise metabolism and maintain lean body mass — a combination of cardio and resistance training, at least 30 minutes, five days a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "But beyond the reduction in metabolic speed, it’s crucial to realize that there is a psychological component at play, according to Deena Adimoolam, MD, an assistant professor of diabetes, endocrinology, and bone disease at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always explain to patients that they are in a constant battle with their mind and body due to the hormonal changes associated with weight loss,” Adimoolam tells Yahoo Beauty. “Their body has maintained a certain size for many years, and their body wants to do everything to go back to the weight it used to be. They need to constantly say no to cravings and understand the difference between true hunger and habitual eating.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Your body will try to trick you. “I work with patients to establish their daily caloric needs to maintain their normal bodily functions and then teach them how to calorie count and estimate the calories that are in the foods that they consume,” Adimoolam says. “Patients will tell me that they are ‘starving,’ throughout the day with just three to four meals — even though they are consuming the exact calories that their bodies need.\n",
      "\n",
      "She teaches patients to drink a cup or two of water instead of immediately eating, until the body realizes it’s not starving and not getting more food. “You want to trick the brain into thinking it’s full or satisfied,” she says. “The trick is to outsmart one’s own body and mind — and just say no.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The comic told radio host Howard Stern on Monday that he lost “millions of dollars” over season 1 of the drama series, which premiered unannounced on his website LouisCK.net in January. Low sales for the first four episodes forced him to take a line of credit out to complete the subsequent six episodes. C.K. claimed that each roughly hour-long episode, which C.K. has sold a la carte for $2-5 a piece, costs about $500,000 to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked by Stern whether he had sought any outside financial backing for the show, C.K. said, “Nah, I don’t do that.” Instead, he said, he is relying on a publicity push that includes television appearances and an Emmy campaign to drive viewers to the show, and to his website. “I believe that … by the summer, the show will have paid itself off,” he told Stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "C.K. claimed that he bankrolled production of the first four episodes using $2 million of his own money, leaving him with “no cushion in life,” but counted on making enough through sales of those first four episodes to pay for the rest of the season. Revenue generated from sales of those episodes fell short of expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "C.K. did have the opportunity to seek partnership with FX — home to his Emmy-winning comedy series “Louie” — on “Horace & Pete” prior to beginning work on the series. Through his production company Pig Newton, C.K. has a first-look deal with FX Networks and FX Productions. But instead of pursuing a traditional television deal, C.K. asked for and received FX Networks CEO John Landgraf’s blessing to self-produce and distribute the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "C.K. told Stern that he is open to taking “Horace & Pete” to another platform following its initial run. “I’ll sell it to another outlet — of course I will, down the road,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should C.K. take season 1 of “Horace & Pete” to market, the show would not be covered under his first-look deal with FX, a source close to C.K. told Variety — though the network would not be precluded from making a bid. The source added that C.K. is confident that the show will become profitable as it moves from its initial run to later windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "C.K. is also preparing to introduce a sales option on his site that will allow all episodes of “Horace & Pete” to be purchased in one transaction. Right now, episodes con only be purchased individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to “Louie,” whose future remains uncertain while C.K. focuses on other projects, C.K. exec produces three more FX shows — Zach Galifianakis comedy “Baskets,” which the network renewed in February for a second season, and upcoming series “Better Things” and “The Secret Life of Pets.” He also serves as executive producer on Amazon series “One Mississippi” from FX Productions.\n",

      "Annnnd I think I just teared up a little while typing that paragraph. Damn it, I’d barely recovered from my crying jag over Wednesday’s top three opening number, of Kygo’s “Stole the Show,” which featured the following heartbreaking lyrics:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now/Watching, watching, as the credits all roll down/Crying, crying, you know we’re playing to a full house, house/No heroes, villains, one to blame/While wilted roses filled the stage/And the thrill, the thrill is gone/Our debut was a masterpiece/But in the end for you and me/Oh, the show, it can’t go on/We used to have it all, but now’s our curtain call/So hold for the applause/And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow/Oh, it’s our time to go, but at least we stole the show…\n",

      "Man. It’s so hard to process that 15 seasons of American Idol are coming to an end. But I am going to enjoy every last fleeting minute of whatever’s left of this season. Thankfully, on Wednesday, the top two sang three times – their potential singles (or “coronation songs”), selections by show creator Simon Fuller, and encore performances that the contestants picked themselves. Let’s get to Reality Rocks’ (gulp) last competitive-show Idol recap. Ever.\n",

      "CORONATION SONGS\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent Harmon, “Falling”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as Phillip Phillips in Season 11 got a legit song that could actually compete on the radio (“Home,” which went on to sell 5 million copies), Trent really lucked out with his single. “Falling” (co-written by Keith Urban, who grooved and sang along excitedly behind his desk) is an alt-bluesy barnstormer – think Alex Clare, John Newman, Amos Lee – and it’s a perfect song for Trent. And judging from the way he tore into this song like it was a medium-rare filet mignon from the Longhorn Fish & Steakhouse, Trent was thrilled with it. He sang it with so much gusto, I thought his famously wobbly jaw was going to dislodge and fall right off from overuse. (That’s a compliment, by the way.)\n",
      "\n",
      "La’Porsha Renae, “Battles”\n",
      "\n",
      "La’Porsha got a more traditional-sounding coronation song, a triumph-over-adversity power ballad about “never giving up.” The song of course spoke to La’Porsha’s own emotional backstory, and she seemed comfortable onstage, working the crowd (and a fantastic outfit) with huge smile on her face. But the song was weak, and unlike fellow belter Trent’s single, it was not a suitable showcase for her magnificent vocals. Seriously, last week’s “Glory” would have been a better coronation single for La’Porsha than “Battles.” Actually, Scott Borchetta could have even given her “This Is My Now 2016” and it would’ve been an improvement. La’Porsha sang well, but she deserved better than this treacle. Borchetta, get her back in the studio and give her a hotter track!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dalton Rapattoni, “Strike a Match”\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated earlier with a somewhat heavy heart, Dalton didn’t make it to the top two, but at least he got a proper sendoff package – unlike last year’s poor third-placer Jax, who was brushed aside during the top two show’s extremely cold open, and practically escorted off the set by security, before Kieran had even dimmed the lights. This Wednesday, Dalton got to sing one more song before his exit, and it was “Strike a Match,” which would have been his first single. (You can still buy it on iTunes and Amazon.) His song wasn’t as catchy as Trent’s, but it was better than La’Porsha’s schmaltzfest – and, as was the case with Trent, it was a perfect match (no pun intended) of singer and song. The upbeat, Jimmy Eat Worldly pop-rock anthem is exactly the kind of music I always imagined Dalton would make after Idol (and hope he will make, because I think he has a career ahead of him). Dalton sang it like he wrote it – and like he’d already won. In some ways, he did win. Congrats, Mr. Rapattoni, on a great run.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trent Harmon, “If You Don’t Know Me by Now”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly Fuller knows Trent by now, and knows what sort of artist Trent should be. He chose this song very wisely. The Gamble & Huff classic, first recorded in 1972 by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, could have come across as dull and old-fashioned (I recall other singing-competition contestants struggling to slog through it), but Trent did for it in 2016 what Simply Red did for it in 1989. He gave the song new life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has been extraordinary to watch how far you’ve come in this competition, and absolutely amazing to see you onstage going up against La’Porsha. You have given her a run for the money like I’ve never seen,” said Keith. (Side note: I don’t know why the judges kept depicting Trent as the underdog this evening. It has been abundantly clear since he sang “Chandelier” two weeks ago that he is the contestant to beat.)\n",
      "\n",
      "La’Porsha Renae, “A House Is Not a Home”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuller sure loves old Idol standards – Tamyra Gray had a big moment with this Bacharach & David ballad way back Season 1. But La’Porsha gave it a gorgeous update. She made me feel every word. My tears sprang anew as she performed “House” as if it were, well, her coronation song.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love the Luther Vandross version, and the Dionne Warwick version, and now we have the La’Porsha version,” gushed Jennifer Lopez. “One of the greatest things about the way you sing lyrics, you never overdo them. You keep them in the realm of believability. That told me a lot. From a musical point of view, you spoke volumes about what you know about harmony. To provide that with a great lyric interpretation and something that moves me is about all you can ask for,” raved Harry Connick Jr. “All I know is that I don’t even smoke, and I need a cigarette right now,” joked Keith, in one of his best critiques ever. Well played, Mr. Urban. Well played.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trent Harmon, “Chandelier”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, apparently lightning can strike twice. It was no surprise that Trent would choose his Sia Week breakthrough for his reprise, but “Chandelier” had been such a high point for him, he ran the risk of not living up to that fantastic, not-too-distant memory. But instead Trent actually did the unimaginable and topped himself. He swung for the chandelier, and he succeeded. This was stupendous. The audience’s joyous shrieking was so loud and out-of-control afterwards, the judges could barely get a chance to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were going to do anything to make this the hardest decision probably in the history of American Idol, that was it,” said Harry. “For some people, you might have made it an easier decision,” Keith interjected, adding: “An extraordinary performance. Your vocal transition from chest to head and falsetto is so gorgeous. A real magnificent thing to get to hear you sing that.” And then Jennifer summed it up with: “From the very beginning, I saw something so special in you. I knew you would be here in the last two… You deserve to win. You do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "La’Porsha Renae, “Diamonds”\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, maybe this was La’Porsha’s proper coronation moment. “Diamonds” was La’Porsha’s first real breakout on Idol, many weeks ago – the first time I realized she could (and maybe should) win. And tonight, she had a full-circle moment with it – vamping it up, totally letting go, and embellishing it effortlessly. She took it to a new level. She was shining brighter and more diamond-like than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is what I can’t wait for: to go to a show of yours, and see you let loose. You know, like, ‘I don’t have to keep it together right now. I can just go off.’ I want to be there,” said Jennifer. (Side note: I want to be there, too. That’s why I wish there was a tour this summer!) And then, Harry delivered the final critique of the entire series. And it was: “I have nothing to say. Amazing.” It seemed like a bit of a wasted opportunity, but then again, maybe all of America was speechless, realizing that they’d just seen the final Idol competitive performance ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, for the last time… it is prediction time. Who’s going to win this thing and become that “Kelly Clarkson bookend”? I can declare with 99 percent confidence that it will be Trent. He easily won round one and narrowly won round three, and while J.Lo gave round two to La’Porsha, I think that round was a tie. Keith claimed this will be “the closest race in Idol history,” but I disagree.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you know what they say… it ain’t over till a cast of about 50 Idols sing! So join me Thursday night with a massive box of Kleenex, as your Idol favorites put on the show of shows. Thanks to returning producer Nigel Lythgoe, there will be Bowie medleys, rock medleys, diva medleys, medleys upon medleys, and probably a lot of wonderfully cheesy step-touch group numbers.\n",

      "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis issues one of the most eagerly awaited documents of his pontificate on Friday, a treatise on marriage and the family following two gatherings of Catholic bishops that exposed divisions in the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is keen anticipation on what the 260-page document “Amoris Laetitia,” (The Joy of Love), will say about the full re-integration into the Church of Catholics who divorce and remarry in civil ceremonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under current Church teaching they cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex with their new partner, because their first marriage is still valid in the eyes of the Church and they are seen to be living in an adulterous state of sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way such Catholics can remarry is if they receive an annulment, a ruling that their first marriage never existed in the first place because of the lack of certain pre-requisites such as psychological maturity or free will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francis, who has made numerous calls for a more merciful Church, has changed procedures to make obtaining annulments less cumbersome and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following an unprecedented poll of Catholics around the world, bishops held two summits, known as synods, at the Vatican in October 2014 and October 2015 to discuss family issues, such as why fewer Catholics are getting married and more are getting divorce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bishops’ final document at the second synod spoke of a so-called “internal forum” in which a priest or a bishop may work with a Catholic who has divorced and remarried to decide jointly, privately and on a case-by-case basis if he or she can be fully re-integrated and receive communion.\n",
      "\n",
      "While progressives such as Cardinal Walter Kasper of Germany, who is one of Francis’ favorite theologians, favor this approach, it is opposed by conservatives, who say it would undermine the principle of the indissolubility of marriage that Jesus established.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the synod last year, Francis excoriated immovable Church leaders who he said “bury their heads in the sand” and hide behind rigid doctrine while families suffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The papal document, formally known as a Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation, is also expected to call for better programs for marriage preparation and echo the synod’s stand that homosexual unions cannot be equated with heterosexual marriage.\n",

      "It seems that every few weeks we hear about a student being shamed for his or her attire at school. The tradition continues at the National Law School of India University in Bangalore, where a professor took it upon himself to humiliate a female student for wearing shorts to class. According to Legally India, professor V Nagaraj allegedly railed into a shorts-clad third-year student, at one point saying, “We all know why parents marry their children off — so that they can have sex. Just because the parents marry off their children for this reason, it does not mean that the children have sex in front of their parents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "God only knows how one can make the leap from wearing shorts to class to having sex in front of one’s parents (which, by the way, ew), but when you’re making ridiculous statements in the first place, illogical reasoning is to be expected. Nagaraj also called the student’s values into question, allegedly saying, “You can come to class without a dress, also. That is how your character is, I’m going to ignore you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately for this prudish prof, his students did not take so kindly to his unhinged rant. To show solidarity with the young woman, her classmates protested the incident by showing up to class in shorts. After the professor refused to apologize, the students wrote a “statement of condemnation” over the issue. “We find such behaviour extremely unacceptable, especially coming from a Professor, who students are expected to consider as a role model. NLS has taught us to value discourse above everything else and to be tolerant of individual choices. The behaviour highlighted above goes against the spirit of this institution. Therefore, we believe it is imperative that such aberrant actions be denounced by the University as a whole with immediate effect. We also demand that a public apology be issued by the teacher in question to the concerned student and the institution as a whole.” NLSIU does not have a dress code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former head of the NLSIU sexual harassment committee professor VS Elizabeth weighed in on the issue via email. “I must say that it is important that all of us, particularly, faculty should think before we make comments, particularly should not be casting aspersions on people’s character based on what they wear or don’t wear. After all the amount of cloth we use to cover our bodies does not proportionately reflect our morality. Many sexual abusers of children and women most certainly wear more clothes, does it mean that they are more moral than the rest of us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We are in a time when notions of proper dress for both men and women are being challenged, as well as the attitudes that go along with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Buchanan High School, in Clovis, Calif., students got together in protest of their rigid dress code, urging the school to consider a more gender-neutral one. The demonstrations, which included male students donning dresses to class, worked so well that the school district later adopted the gender-neutral dress code.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Tottenville High School, in Staten Island, N.Y., kids came to class in crop tops, shorts, tank tops, and the like to rail against the school’s extremely strict dress code. One of the students argued on Twitter, “I didn’t go to public school to be told how ‘I’m allowed’ to express myself … I can respect myself 150% and still wear shorts and a tank top. Maybe instead of worrying about what I’m wearing, you should worry about the fact that I’m going to graduate high school with next to no life skills whatsoever.”\n",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO – Michael Phelps scored a spectacular double Tuesday night, further underscoring that he is primed to bow out of swimming in a blaze of golden glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 70 minutes after winning gold in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam a leg of the United States’ gold-medal-winning 800 freestyle relay. Phelps was not a lock to swim the event after not posting an elite-level 200 free time all year, but his spectacular performance in the 400 free relay Sunday night made him an obvious option for the 800.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phelps swam the anchor leg with a split 1:45.26. He teamed with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas and fellow swimming legend Ryan Lochte to easily win the event in 7:00.66. Great Britain won silver in 7:03.13 while Japan took bronze in 7:03.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the 31-year-old Phelps announced his most recent comeback, the expectation was for a limited number of events as a concession to his advanced age by swimming standards. But he’s now on track for six medals, and all six could be gold.\n",

      "That would give Phelps four Olympic performances with six or more medals, a staggering accomplishment. He is the all-time leader in Olympic medals (25) and golds (21).\n",

      "BEREA, Ohio – In many NFL management turnovers, there is a concerted effort by new staffs to put distance between a team and a previous malaise of failure. Coaching staffs are gutted. Front offices are burned to the ground. Rosters are torn open at the seams. Some franchises even redraw the lines in the parking lot, a sort of desperate Feng shui to instigate change in every last inch of real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cleveland Browns have been there. Repeatedly. And if they’re inclined to listen, someone will remind them every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People are going to say a lot of things,” Browns head coach Hue Jackson said. “I tell my coaches and players, be careful what you let go into your ears. Because that doesn’t mean that’s what you’re going to be. This is going to be whatever you decide it’s going to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is this going to be? The Browns are still figuring that out. But Jackson has part of the answer right now, starting with the lowest of bars. This won’t be a disaster. It won’t be the train wreck that some have predicted, suggesting this roster and coaching staff and front office are destined for another merciless season. At the very least, Jackson is standing up against the cruelest kind of punditry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard all the different things said, that maybe we’ll only win one game or maybe we’ll win no games,” Jackson said. “I hate when that’s said, because that says that Joe Thomas is not a good player. It says Joe Haden’s not a good player. It says [Gary] Barnidge is not a good player. … There are some good players here. The cupboard’s not bare. It’s probably not full, but there are players here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot of this season wrapped up in the belief that there are some players on the Browns’ roster. Even in the most optimistic quarters, it would be a stretch to imagine this being a franchise that flips a one-season switch and suddenly becomes playoff-worthy. But there are still other victories to be had, and Jackson and the Browns’ brain trust are already sensing them within their grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than anything, that’s what 2016 is about for this staff. Finding some cornerstones on a roster filled with youth. Instilling a sense of conviction and accountability that may not have been supported on previous staffs or in past football decisions. And maybe more than anything, getting the fan base to rebuy into the build with actions rather than promises or slogans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish we had the exact right answer,” head of football operations Sashi Brown said of his benchmarks for progress. “The first thing is accountability. I mean that a couple different ways. When we’re out here practicing, are we getting better every day? Are we competing every day? You’re seeing that. But until you see it on the field …”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown didn’t need to finish that sentence. Everyone who has pumped emotion into this franchise has the remainder of that thought seared into them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of wariness is fair. It has been constructed over several decades of failure. And in some ways, the reticence is invited. In truth, there is some conflict and risk within the early stages of this build. There are some leaps of trust. The Browns are preaching self-accountability and change, yet they brought in quarterback Robert Griffin, who was criticized (fairly or not) as being one of the least accountable players on the Washington Redskins’ roster in recent years. He was officially named the starting quarterback on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "This regime also extended another chance to wideout Josh Gordon, who hasn’t played since 2014 – by virtue of suspensions that would seem to spell out a lack of personal accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Browns are expected to lean heavily on these two players in the rebuild, which says something about the fine line being walked in Cleveland. It straddles the concepts of total culture change and hopeful rehabilitation. Maybe no player epitomizes that more than Gordon, who has deep roots in the past failures of this team but who also can be a major part of the pivot point that leads to an ascent. From the outside looking in, the world sees suspensions and mistakes. Brown and the front office know this.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And him hanging out with Johnny [Manziel], all that stuff, right?” Brown says. “You take it all into account. We had that discussion. I can’t just walk him back in [without that in mind].\n",
      "\n",
      "“Part of [the decision to keep Gordon] was – it was the same way with Robert [Griffin]. From the outside, you looked at the Washington situation and why would you touch him? But you sit down and you talk to him. At the same time, is there risk? Absolutely. …\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got to be an environment we think [Gordon] can be successful in. He’s got to be a guy who we feel like can do it and is seriously committed to doing it. If you don’t feel that, he wouldn’t have been here. Is it necessarily the case yet? No. I think he’s realistic. He knows he’s got to prove it. We’re realistic about it. He’s not a knucklehead. He’s obviously extremely talented, too. I wouldn’t tell you we’d be doing this for the 90th guy on the roster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The talent matters in Gordon’s case. But he also has no shortage of allies in the locker room and upper reaches of the franchise, and that weighed heavily on the decision to retain a player who has come to represent a lot of past frustrations. Maybe even moreso than Manziel, Gordon is a player who has taken teammates to the end of their patience because they gravitate to his personality and loyalty. Oddly enough, nobody knows that better than Griffin, the former University of Baylor teammate who has been through his own brand of locker room turmoil.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be quite frank, if [Josh] was an [expletive], he wouldn’t be here,” Griffin said. “And he’s not. That’s not who he is. I for one pray that he can show people his real colors and who he really is. I think that’s what he’s out to do. He’s still going to go out and try to be the best football player he can, but I think he wants to show people he’s a good person, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From all accounts, Gordon was a very long and detailed topic of discussion internally. So was Griffin. Indeed, the front office and coaching staff have done a significant amount of collaborative think-tanking on almost every consequential player on the roster. In a way, keeping any single veteran player was approached in a manner similar to drafting promising wideout Corey Coleman. With questions about long-term fit, short-term risk and reward and thought given to how the player would function in a changing culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Jackson and his staff and a front office that includes many weighing in – including Brown and chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta – the Browns have pushed to understand how each player fits on an individual basis. Some are written into the long-term plans. Others are not. The roster turnover the next two offseasons will reveal that. Still others, including guys like Gordon and Griffin, are in the midst of writing their roles going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson is right. The cupboard in Cleveland is not bare. It’s also not full. But it’s also not as bad as it has been made out to be. The focus now is finding pieces that can grow and be accentuated by a haul of 10 picks in the 2017 NFL draft. Not that Jackson is accepting the insults and predictions that 2016 is already destined to be a complete failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not going to tell you that kind of talk didn’t sting me,” Jackson said. “It did. But if anything, it motivates me to get it right. Moreso than anything. We don’t want to be the laughingstock of anything. We want to be the best at what we do. I didn’t come here to lose. I came here to win.”\n"

      "NEW YORK – Alex Rodriguez left Yankee Stadium just before midnight Friday, surrounded by family and friends. He wore a black suit and a silver tie, the shirt beneath white and crisp as a wedding invitation. In a pocket, he carried a plastic baggy a quarter filled with dirt, the kind they smooth and water and rake near third base and generally leave there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Third base was where I lived,” he said, as though that were explanation enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’d scooped a handful in the few minutes he spent there in the last game he’d ever play as a Yankee, just maybe the last he’d play for anyone, and in the end – just maybe the end of his career – he took about what anyone does, a pocketful of dirt, some decent memories and a few ideas about tomorrow. At that moment, he had but one regret; in his haste to return to third base a final time, he’d neglected to wear a cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So then,” he said, “I was really stressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He is 41 years old. He was one of the finest to ever play the game, which should cover the story of Alex Rodriguez and a career that spanned two decades. It does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty minutes after he waved one last time to a sold-out Yankee Stadium that chanted his name, he summed it up, “I’m someone who loves the game tremendously and has made some tremendous mistakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had one hit, a double, in four at-bats. He stood at third base in the ninth inning for one out. Then he hugged his teammates and his manager. Earlier, it had rained on his farewell ceremony, which many would find appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you went out in your backyard, dug a hole, laid sticks and leaves over it and waited long enough, one morning you’d find Alex Rodriguez down there, hungry, dirty and a little chilly but otherwise fine. You’d perhaps wonder what A-Rod was doing in your backyard to begin with, after coming to terms with A-Rod being in that hole as well, and he may or may not have a reasonable explanation, but he’d have something, and then you’d shrug and tie one end of a rope to the bird feeder and toss the other end to A-Rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is – and always has been – A-Rod. If there is a PED crisis, he will find it. If there is silence, he will break it, awkwardly. If there is a relationship, he will foul it. If there is a back page, he will grace it. If there is a boo, he will wear it. If there is a Hall of Fame, he will be plenty good enough for it, and yet somehow not. And if there is a truly rotten way to end a career – “unconditional release” qualifies – A-Rod will fall into that too, then conjure a way to put it to music and applause, to make it a parade, to walk away with $27 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Rodriguez is not a New York Yankee anymore, not even a ballplayer anymore, not at the moment. He is instead a single father of two with some stories, the latest being the one about filling up a ballpark on a ridiculously hot summer night here so that everyone could watch him go from the middle of a big-league lineup to fired in, like, three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the conclusion of one of those weeks in New York when it was fair to wonder if everything that could have gone wrong actually did. Somebody must have forgotten something.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would, therefore, be instructive to know that the squall struck only after Alex, his mother, his brother, his sister, his two daughters, Mariano Rivera and two Steinbrenner heirs had left the safety of the dugout. First there had been large black clouds. Then distant lightning. Thunder chased the lightning, gaining on it, until the whole loud, wet mess settled atop the farewell party, and in the stands people slouched against the tempest rushed to safety. Alex’s little girls, Natasha and Ella, dressed in pretty outfits, their hair smushed against their heads, looked up and blinked against the driving downfall. Their dad smiled down with a look that offered, “How funny is this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the final thunderclap, he said, “I guess we went out with a bang.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He slept in on Friday morning. Ate egg whites. Shortened his stretching routine due to the late hour. Into the extreme heat and humidity of New York, where on the streets it felt like you were breathing through an aquarium filter, he drove up Broadway, cut through Harlem. The 8 ½-by-11 sheet of paper on the clubhouse door said he would bat third, behind Jacoby Ellsbury and in front of Mark Teixeira, as the designated hitter. He’d hoped to play third base, but it hasn’t been one of those weeks for sentiments like hopes or gestures. He’d get what he got and then pack his stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Um, so far so good,” he said four hours before game time. “Slept pretty well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His mom and girls were flying in from Miami, he said. He looked forward to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You never really prepare for this day,” he said. “But here it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped up from the dugout, threaded the gauntlet of photographers, took batting practice, then hugged the batting practice pitcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Girardi leaned on the batting cage. He’s the guy whose job it was to get Alex Rodriguez from Sunday, when it was announced the Yankees would release him, to Friday, when they would do the releasing. He’s also the guy who believes in the standings and can read a calendar and has his own ideas about the lineup that was most likely to win a ballgame for the Yankees. He’d said things about letting the man with 696 home runs play, then backpedalled from that, thereby ticking off the man with 696 home runs, and then he’d said, “My job description does not entail a farewell tour,” something he might have thought about when he took a position as leader of aging, occasionally dignified superstars. The Yankees do these just about every summer. Girardi is, of course, in a tenuous position, and he wore the visage of a person whose life’s soul objective was to run, trudge, belly-crawl to Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who wants to be that guy?” he wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah, no more than one start in Boston. No third base, until the end. How about a framed jersey and a summer storm instead?\n",
      "\n",
      "This all seemed like the new girlfriend washing her boyfriend’s car so everything is tidy for him to go break up with his soon-to-be old girlfriend. Which I saw happen once. He didn’t come home that night. Things get complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat Thursday night beside a self-identified Boston Red Sox fan at the Smith & Wollensky bar in Manhattan, the lady to my right cheering so hard through an Olympics semifinal, and being so disappointed in Michael Phelps, and finally granting it was OK she supposed for him to win just a silver, so that was exhausting, as she never did seem to grasp what a semifinal is, the Red Sox fan finally saying, “Honestly, I find it hard not to like A-Rod. He seems like a decent guy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s complicated. He hit, he won, he cheated again, he sued, he was punished, he returned, he hit again, he aged, it stayed complicated. It always will be, and even A-Rod – he hit 351 of his 696 home runs as a Yankee, won two of his three MVPs as a Yankee, won his only World Series as a Yankee – can see that. For a man with the clumsiest sense of where and when, he is utterly self-aware, usually after the fact, which is where it gets squishy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hal [Steinbrenner, the club’s managing general partner] has given me an opportunity to stay involved with the organization,” he said. “With all my screw-ups and how badly I’ve acted, the fact that I’m walking out the door and Hal wants me as part of the family, that’s hitting 800 home runs for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there was the matter of three or four more hours as a Yankee, those on the other side of the storm. He signed autographs near the right-field foul pole until the umpires emerged from a tunnel and approached home plate. When the Bleacher Creature role call from right field reached him last, the whole stadium joined in. He waved from the dugout rail. With family and friends watching from a suite with a ceiling, safe from further acts of God and/or karma, Rodriguez batted in the first inning against Chris Archer, the Tampa Bay Rays right-hander. Brett Gardner was at first base. Off a 96-mph fastball, A-Rod rifled a line drive into the right center-field gap. Gardner scored. Upon arriving at second base, A-Rod slapped his hands together, shrieked something along the lines of “[Heck] yeah!” and lifted his batting average from .199 to .203.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’d said for six days his horizon was Friday night. Except there’s always a horizon and no one ever gets there, and maybe that’s what Saturday would be for, a mid-August Saturday when there’d be no baseball for him. The team that was his for 13 years, for 12 seasons (it’s complicated), the family that took him back at contractual gunpoint, that rejoiced in his 33 home runs a season ago, that gave him one last day in the three hole, goes on without him. They all do eventually, and then there’s the business of picking a new horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m gonna miss him,” Girardi, sobbing, said at the end of a long night, a long week, a long era. “I’m gonna miss the guy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe A-Rod will play again, go be a DH, hunt left-handed pitching, get that 700th home run. Maybe he’s just had enough. He said he watched Gary Sanchez, the kid, have a big series in Boston and thought to himself, “I can’t do that anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that could be the end. He’ll wear more suits, raise those little girls of his, and stand pat on a career that was grand, that was wasteful, that was unforgettable. Just in case it all seems too far-fetched in hindsight, that it couldn’t really have gone that way, it’s just too bizarre, well, he’s got the dirt to prove it.\n"

      "Aetna has become the latest health insurer to retreat from the Affordable Care Act’s public exchanges by announcing a pullback that will further deplete customer choices in many pockets of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nation’s third largest insurer says it plans to leave nearly 70 percent of the counties in which it currently sells coverage as it trims exchange participation to four states in 2017, down from 15 this year. The insurer’s late Monday announcement comes after UnitedHealth and Humana detailed their own exchange pull backs for 2017 and after more than a dozen nonprofit insurance co-ops have shut down in the past couple years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dwindling exchange participation from insurers is becoming a concern because competition is supposed to help control insurance price increases, and many carriers have already announced plans to seek price hikes of around 10 percent or more for 2017. Some states like Alaska and Oklahoma will be left with only one participant selling individual coverage in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Urban markets or places with higher populations should still have plenty of health insurance choices on their exchanges for 2017, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor with the Georgetown Health Policy Institute. But that may not be the case in many rural markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be less attractive to insurers because there are fewer customers over which an insurer can spread costs, and hospitals and other health care providers can build dominating market positions, making them formidable negotiating foes over rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health insurers have been finalizing their exchange plans over the past several weeks, ahead of the Nov. 1 start of enrollment for 2017 coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corlette said it may still make take a few more years for insurer exchange participation to settle out, and the government may have to step in to tweak the market for insurers, “but I don’t think the market places are crashing and burning by any means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Aetna had said earlier this month it was canceling expansion plans for its exchange business in 2017, and it promised a hard look at its current participation. The company covered about 838,000 people through the individual exchanges at the end of the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cuts mean it will sell coverage on exchanges in 242 counties next year, down from 778. The Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer will sell on exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exchanges have helped millions of people gain health coverage, most with help from income-based tax credits. But insurers say this relatively small slice of business has generated huge losses since they started paying claims in 2014. Insurers have struggled to enroll enough healthy people to balance the claims they pay from high-cost customers, and they have complained about steep shortfalls in support from government programs designed to help them.\n",

      "Aetna has said it has been swamped with higher than expected costs, particularly from pricey specialty drugs. The nation’s third-largest insurer said a second-quarter pre-tax loss of $200 million from its individual insurance coverage helped it decide to limit exposure to the exchanges.\n",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO – In the aftermath of the greatest team performance in women’s gymnastics history, the buzz is about … Gabby Douglas’ arm at her side during the national anthem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously?\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglas, the Olympic all-around champion at the 2012 London Games, created a stir because she was, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, “slumped with her hands held casually in front of her as if she had just finished last.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, across Olympic Park at the pool, Michael Phelps laughed during the national anthem and it was treated (appropriately) as harmless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglas — who, by the way, is representing her country simply by competing — was accused of being unpatriotic on social media, to such an extent that she felt the need to apologize on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In response to a few tweets I saw tonight, I always stand at attention out of respect for our country whenever the national anthem is played,” she wrote. “I never meant any disrespect and apologize if I offended anyone. I’m so overwhelmed at what our team accomplished today and overjoyed that we were able to bring home another gold for our country!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s too bad she felt she had to apologize. And it’s too bad this has competed for attention with a truly remarkable fortnight for a group of American women. Perhaps Douglas was completely exhausted after a difficult four years. Perhaps she has some stress or anxiety in her life that the public doesn’t know about. Perhaps she simply forgot to put her hand over her heart. All of those reasons would be justifiable. Yet for some reason, Douglas rarely gets the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember what happened in 2012 when Douglas won all-around gold? The conversation on social media back then was about her hair. Four years later, there’s now a story on Allure’s site titled, “People Are Still Talking About Gabby Douglas’s Hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was worse than that, according to a 2012 story in Vanity Fair. Douglas said she was told by a staff member at her gym “she might want to consider reconstructive surgery on her nose because of its flatness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are the kind of comments that can undermine confidence and happiness, especially for a teenager in a spotlight that few of us can fathom.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have no idea what might be going on in Douglas’ life these days. She changed coaches during the U.S. Olympic trials, which was a shock to many in the gymnastics community and a sign of possible turmoil. Still, she made the return trip to the Summer Games, which is an extremely rare feat and one that is celebrated justifiably in the case of Aly Raisman.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Raisman who narrowly beat out Douglas at qualifications, meaning Douglas will part with her all-around crown here on Thursday. Douglas’ response to that in the mixed zone was complete support. She said all the right things about Raisman and the team, even though she had just lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still, the critics have come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gymnastics discussion is separate. Disagreement about whether Laurie Hernandez should have been entered in the all-around competition here is valid. There is an argument to be made that Douglas shouldn’t be on the team after her struggles at trials. But that is a sports discussion. Douglas is dealing with personal scrutiny here. And she shouldn’t be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t as if Douglas covered her ears during the anthem or turned her back. Her face, although hardly ebullient, did not convey disdain. There are photos of her smiling during the anthem. And there aren’t even team rules about expression on the podium. Just stand and face the flag. That’s what Douglas did throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, this is someone who has competed for her country, in red, white, and blue, in two separate Olympics. This is a team of unprecedented talent and achievement – one that drew raves from opponents after the team all-around competition. Gabby Douglas, like her teammates, has made America look like a winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s fairly patriotic, no?\n",

      "\n",
      "During a contentious press conference after she won the silver medal in the 200-meter breaststroke, Efimova answered the question about King’s comments by saying: “What would she say about Michael Phelps?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A picture of Phelps smoking a bong circulated in 2009, and he was suspended by USA Swimming for three months. Following a 2014 DUI, Phelps received a six-month suspension. Phelps, who won his 22nd gold medal and 26th Olympic medal Thursday night, never has tested positive for any kind of performance-enhancing drug in or out of competition. A spokesperson for Russian swimming clarified to The Wall Street Journal that Efimova was alluding to Phelps’ use of non-performance-enhancing substances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course I’m not for doping, and I’ve never used it on purpose,” Efimova said. “But I know there have been very many occasions where people do it because they don’t know or because they’re stupid or naïve. There always should be another chance. When you are driving a car and break a rule, you get only a ticket. You don’t lose your license for life or get put in jail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Efimova resented the continuous questions about her suspension for DHEA, which was reduced from two years to 16 months because she was believed to have taken it unknowingly, and her recent positive test for meldonium, the drug popular with Eastern European athletes that earned Maria Sharapova a two-year suspension. Before the Rio Games began, she was one of 271 Russian athletes cleared to compete by the International Olympic Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is, once again, the same question,” Efimova said. “I’ve already answered, yes. On one occasion, I made a mistake. All over the world, in every country, you’ll find similar cases, including the United States. What happened next, it was not my fault. I was right. And the week before the beginning here, I won in the courts. I don’t think I have to be subject to any questions in this regard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sighing deeply, the 24-year-old Efimova, who swam collegiately at USC and continues to train in the United States, cast aspersions on the U.S. swim team as well as other critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said it before, and I think I can say it now: There are only two Americans I respect and I can listen,” Efimova said. “And those are [swimming coaches] Jon Urbanchek and Dave Salo. All the other guys who say [bad things], I don’t care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Efimova won her second silver of the Olympics on Thursday night in the 200-meter breaststroke, finishing 1.67 seconds behind gold medalist Rie Kaneto of Japan. When asked about Efimova, Kaneto said that once the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared her, she should have been permitted to race in the Olympics.\n",

      "The billionaire real estate mogul named Stephen Bannon of the conservative Breitbart News website as chief executive officer and promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager.

      "\n",
      "In tapping Bannon for a top campaign role, Trump is doubling down on his outsider appeal rather than appeasing more traditional Republicans. The conservative Breitbart figure has been a cheerleader for Trump’s campaign for months and was critical of Republican leaders, including Ryan. Bannon is a former Goldman Sachs banker and does not bring presidential campaign experience to Trump’s White House bid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has resisted pleas from fellow Republicans to overhaul the flame-throwing approach on the campaign trail that powered his surge to the top of the Republican field in the primary season. Instead of working to broaden his appeal, Trump has largely hewed to the large rallies and attention-grabbing comments that appealed to the party base.\n",

      "Manafort deputy Rick Gates, who has been traveling often with Trump, is expected to maintain a senior role with the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manafort, who took over the reins following the departure of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in June, has come under scrutiny because of his past work for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Manafort helped the party secretly route at least $2.2 million in payments to two prominent Washington lobbying firms in 2012, doing so in a way that effectively obscured the party’s efforts to influence U.S. policy. Gates, who had worked with Manafort on Ukrainian issues, told the AP he and Manafort had consulted with the lobbying firms on Ukrainian politics, but called the actions lawful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign shakeup, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as polls show Trump trailing Clinton nationally and in key battleground states following a difficult campaign stretch that saw him insulting the Muslim parents of a U.S. Army soldier who died in Iraq and temporarily refraining from endorsing House Speaker Paul Ryan in his primary race.\n",

      "\n",
      "Manuel’s history-making gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle on Thursday earned her praise well beyond the U.S. swimming community.

      "Manuel admitted she was surprised to have won gold in the 100-meter freestyle, and her medal in the 50 freestyle was also a bit unexpected. She had qualified sixth from the semifinals on Friday after her bus arrived to the swimming venue late. She finished in 24.09, just off the gold medal-winning time of 24.07 by Denmark’s Pernille Blume and a significant improvement from her previous personal best of 24.33.

      "All told, the authors identified nine key hallmarks of aging on your metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s be careful about our terms here: Your metabolism isn’t some organ or group of organs in your body that determines how many sugary foods you can eat before noticing a bulge on your waistline. Rather, it’s the billions of actions all of your cells take every second of every day to convert fuel into energy and put together the complex compounds necessary for your body to function.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you get old, your metabolism becomes less efficient. Your DNA becomes more damaged, introducing errors and inefficiency to how your cells function. Your body’s process for destroying and eliminating old, exhausted cells (“autophagy”) slows down, which has a number of negative effects on your well-being. And all the stress your body has experienced over the course of your lifetime makes it less able to perform the daily quality-control tasks necessary for health.\n",

      "\n",
      "(Eat like you’re from here.Shutterstock)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If aging is a disease of the metabolism, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the fuel you put into your body can have a serious impact on your longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a strong body of evidence to suggest that what’s known as a Mediterranean diet can extend your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s shorthand for a diet high in healthy fats like olive oil, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish — and with little red meat or sugar. They make a point of noting that replacing proteins with healthy complex carbohydrates seems to offer serious benefits to longevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also helpful: Calorie restriction. In part, this practice simply refers to not overeating. But perhaps just as important is building periods of fasting into your routine — evidence suggests that doing this for just several hours a day might have a real benefit for some people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, and this should surprise no one, regularly exercise appears to help slow down all nine of the major hallmarks of aging identified in the paper.\n",

      "Our “westernized” lifestyles are killing us\n",
      "\n",
      "While improvements in healthcare and public safety have created drastic improvements in lifespans in the “Western” world, there’s still a lot to worry about.\n",
      "\n",
      "A high-calorie diet heavy in sugar, animal proteins from red meat, and unhealthy fats like margarine stresses our metabolisms and can increase the risks of obesity. Many Americans fail to consume nutritious vegetables, fibers, and whole grains. And most of us simply do not work out enough and spend far too many hours not moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is serious enough, the study authors write, that they end the paper with a call to action, ostensibly meant to encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a lot we still don’t know\n",
      "\n",
      "The most significant part of this paper is that it brings together the dozens of disparate studies on aging, identifying and highlighting both some of the common threads in the science and some of the major gaps in our knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest problems with aging research that the paper touches on, for example, is the fact that only a fraction of all of our \"aging science\" comes from studies of people. Instead, the vast majority of that research is done in lab animals like flies, worms, and mice.There’s strong evidence for the positive impacts of interventions like caloric restriction on longevity in these animals, but the details are still fuzzy.\n",

      "CHICAGO – When Dwyane Wade’s free-agent interest in the Chicago Bulls reached Jimmy Butler, it was Butler who became consumed with making the potential partnership a reality. The franchise’s lone All-Star, in between promotional events in Los Angeles, had placed calls to Wade and made clear his desire for Wade to leave Miami and sign with Chicago. Butler has admitted he could have better handled his relationships with two resolute leaders in Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, and here comes one more into his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Butler wanted Wade – and got him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wade returned to his hometown for a news conference on Friday, and one teammate stood 15 feet to his left inside the Advocate Center: Butler. Bulls guard Rajon Rondo had called himself, Wade and Butler, “Three alphas,” and the immediate challenges of their cohesion looms over next season. Wade and Rondo have withstood trials and confrontations from major NBA stars and their egos for championships – Shaquille O’Neal, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen between them – but this task is fresh for Butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "This roster and its personalities are a combustible proposition. The talents of Rondo, Wade and Butler call for elevated ball usage, and all are most potent mid-range jumper and in. Off the court, Wade has understood his responsibility goes beyond the $47 million contract and statistical production. He remembered Shaq’s introduction to the Heat in 2004, O’Neal declaring the team as Wade’s, and implemented the same response to these Bulls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is Jimmy Butler’s team,” Wade said on Friday afternoon. “Him calling me during free agency – this wouldn’t be possible without Jimmy Butler. Me and Rondo will bring what we do as athletes and leaders … but it won’t be a tug and pull on whose team this is.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw how Shaq handled it. I was 24 and playing for the U.S. team at the time that Shaq joined the Heat, and now Jimmy is 26 and he’s playing for the U.S. team. I love to play with a guy like Rondo; we’ve both had championship experiences. Jimmy will get better with what Rondo and I bring to the table.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Bulls plan to move forward with this core of Rondo, Wade and Butler, and evaluate the progress in training camp and the regular season. They pursued a deal for Kris Dunn of Providence, and made overtures to Minnesota for the No. 5 pick and explosive guard Zach LaVine, as The Vertical reported on draft night. When the Timberwolves maintained their offer of guard Ricky Rubio and the No. 5 pick, Chicago moved on, reassured Butler of his stature within the organization and turned to free agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of Butler over the past several years has been crafted in his rejection of a $44 million extension in 2014 to sign a $95 maximum deal last offseason, along with national exposure, but has yet to translate with his teammates, with significant playoff victories, with the proper understanding of a star’s leadership. In times of struggle or injury, his relationships with Rose and Noah turned unstable, and both now relish the opportunity as teammates with the New York Knicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part, Wade left his breakup with Miami in the past, and confirmed he and Pat Riley never had communication during free agency, that he only held negotiations with Micky and Nick Arison. “They’re the ones cutting the check,” he said. For Riley and Miami, this was a change of direction – away from the Heat’s longtime franchise cornerstone and toward younger players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wade has listened to the perception that these Bulls are his as the sole leader and star. He has eliminated that, and so did Rondo. They go through Jimmy Butler now – whether genuine or by design. Pursuing the construction of a formidable bond with another Marquette alum, this is Wade’s first duty, and it’s on Butler too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I need all the information on you, Jimmy,” Wade said, pointing at Butler. “What time you go to bed, what time you wake up. Your habits. …I’m not trying to play 40 minutes, I’ll let the young Bull over there handle it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jimmy Butler had received knowledge of Wade considering joining Chicago earlier this month, and people around him say no message from a Bulls exec was needed. Butler made the call to Dwyane Wade, made his pitch about succeeding together, and the pressure to co-exist has followed Wade’s arrival.\n",

      "Donald Trump on Tuesday pointedly declined to endorse either House Speaker Paul Ryan or Sen. John McCain in their Republican primaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking with the Washington Post, Trump even used Ryan’s own words against him when the Wisconsin lawmaker had earlier declined to endorse Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,” Trump told the Post’s Philip Rucker. “We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I’m just not quite there yet. I’m not quite there yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A Ryan campaign spokesperson shot back: “Neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump’s endorsement. And we are confident in a victory next week regardless.” Ryan is facing off against Paul Nehlen in next Tuesday’s GOP primary.\n",

      "Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s comments to the Post mirrored what Ryan said about Trump earlier this year, shortly after the Manhattan real estate developer became the presumptive Republican nominee. In May, Ryan sparked a firestorm of his own when he said of a Trump endorsement: “I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Ryan and McCain have since announced their support — with reservations — for Trump’s campaign. But neither Ryan nor McCain would defend Trump after he recently drew widespread condemnation for feuding with the Khan family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khizr Khan appeared with his wife at last week’s Democratic National Convention and used his speech there to passionately denounce Trump’s proposal to bar Muslims from the U.S. Khan said Trump would have prevented his son, who heroically died in the Iraq War, from immigrating to the U.S. Trump responded by questioning why Khan’s wife was silent during the DNC speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan then issued a statement praising the Khans’ son as a “hero” and reiterating his opposition to Trump’s proposal to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration and tourist travel. And McCain, the party’s 2008 presidential nominee, went even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier’s parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States — to say nothing of entering its service,” McCain said in a statement released by his office Monday. “I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers or candidates.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his interview with the Post, Trump also revived his criticism of McCain’s legislative performance on veterans’ issues. Last year, Trump infamously said McCain — a decorated veteran who spent years as a POW in the Vietnam War — was not a “hero.” He quickly reversed himself on the “hero” comment but repeatedly attacked McCain’s supposed lack of accomplishments for U.S. veterans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve never been there with John McCain because I’ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets,” Trump said Tuesday. “He has not done a good job for the vets, and I’ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets. So I’ve always had a difficult time with John for that reason, because our vets are not being treated properly. They’re not being treated fairly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also criticized New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, another GOP critic of his spat with the Khan family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know Kelly Ayotte,” he said. “I know she’s given me no support — zero support — and yet I’m leading her in the polls. I’m doing very well in New Hampshire. We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don’t need weak people. We have enough of them. We need fighters in this country. But Kelly Ayotte has given me zero support, and I’m doing great in New Hampshire.”\n",

      "Earlier in the day Tuesday, President Obama said at a press conference that Trump’s remarks about the Khans were the latest evidence that Trump is unfit to be commander in chief. Obama called on Republican leaders to rescind their Trump endorsements.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, ‘If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer?’” Obama said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The depth and brilliance of the Americans was on display throughout, as the team of Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez and Madison Kocian took a .700 lead on the field after the first apparatus and continued to extend it throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was up to 4.026 after two and 4.961 after three, as the rout was on. The United States finished with a total of 184.897. Russia (176.688) won silver. China (176.003) took home the bronze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous Olympic record for margin of victory was 5.066 set by the 2012 American team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to a decided advantage in degree of difficulty, the Americans didn’t need to be perfect to win. They were close anyway, though, with no major gaffes and just a few minor mistakes. This was not an event full of drama, just excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The victory was a crowning achievement for national team coordinator Marta Karolyi, who at 73 is set to retire after these Games. Since taking over for her husband, Bela, at the turn of the century, the U.S. had turned into a gymnastics juggernaut both on the individual and team level that has left the rest of the world unable to maintain a competitive level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biles was the American anchor, the only member to perform in all four disciplines, batting clean up on three of them. The 19-year-old from Spring, Texas, and UCLA delivered team-high scores on vault (15.933), balance beam (15.300) and floor exercise (15.800) and showed a level of gymnastics that far exceeds anyone else in the world. Her gold-clinching final performance on floor left her teammates bouncing and cheering in jubilation and the gymnastics hall on its feet in appreciation of history unfolding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biles is expected to dominate individual competition the rest of the Olympics, favored to win not just all-around gold but take first on three apparatus competitions. If she does that, she will become the first female gymnast to capture five gold medals in a single Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raisman, of Needham, Mass., and Douglas, of Virginia Beach, Va., were also members of the 2012 gold medal team, returning, in part, for an afternoon like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raisman was solid as ever on vault (15.833), beam (15.000) and floor (15.366). Douglas, the all-around champion at the London Games, participated in bars and delivered an impressive 15.766. Kocian, the team’s bars specialist out of Dallas, brought the house down with a brilliant 15.933.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, New Jersey’s Laurie Hernandez, who was bypassed for Douglas for all-around qualifying, proved her overall skill by competing in three events vaults (15.100), beam (15.233) and then floor, where her typically electric performance delighted the crowd and the judges (14.833).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was that kind of effort for the Americans, overwhelming favorites due to their combination of individual genius, depth of talent and mental focus. They met those expectations and then some, setting a new standard in women’s gymnastics for future teams — in the States or anywhere — to chase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gymnastics competition continues the rest of the week, with the women’s all-around on Thursday, where Biles and Raisman are favored to go gold-silver.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I don’t throw babies out, believe me. I love babies. I love my children. I love babies. I don’t throw babies out, believe me,” Trump assured his fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remarks came in the midst of an attack on his rival Hillary Clinton and illustrated, Trump said, how his campaign was “bucking the press.” He said the media’s coverage of the incident illustrated how unfair reporters are.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, an interesting thing happened. I was in Florida, we have these massive crowds,” he recalled. “Massive crowds. Thousands of people had to be turned away. But massive crowds. At one of the events, a beautiful baby was crying. And I mean crying like you wouldn’t believe,” he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump evidently misspoke about the location of the incident; it was in Virginia.\n",

      "“I jokingly said, ‘You know what? That’s OK. Let the baby cry, we love babies.’ You know, something to that effect: ‘We love babies.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Trump said, the baby “just went on” during his speech to the “thousands of people in the room.” He compared the child to the famous Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and joked that he would find the parents in order to train their kid as an opera singer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said, ‘You know what? I’m going to counteract my order. Beautiful baby — if you take her outside, that’s not so bad,’” he said. “The press came out with headlines: ‘Trump throws baby out of arena.’ So dishonest. I mean, these are dishonest people.”\n",

      "It’s markedly different from the reaction in 2012 to photos of Kate Middleton sunbathing topless, released by the French magazine Closer. People called them “shameful” and criticized the magazine for daring to publish them. One comment on the Daily Mail’s website went as far as to blame Middleton: “Honey, if you don’t want naked photos of yourself, draw the curtains!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, this double standard isn’t rare. “Our media tends to sexualize men far less than women,” Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist, tells Yahoo Beauty. “Naked women are turned into a ‘forbidden and shameful’ space, which makes it titillating, which then sells.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaming of female nudity is also a form of control, Durvasula says. “Men have more privilege in most societies, and as a result have more control over perception and negative branding of their nude imagery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expectations play a role. Women often struggle not to be seen as sex objects, but if they are photographed naked, people may assume they’re uninhibited, hypersexual, and of questionable morals, according to David Frederick, Ph.D., an assistant professor in health psychology at Chapman University who conducts research on body image. “This judgment can be especially true for women who are in roles where they are expected to be feminine and pure,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men seldom run into the same problem. When they’re naked, we tend to see it as funny, natural, and even sexy — it just doesn’t have the same taboo attached to it. “It’s similar to our reactions about sex — we either turn it into a joke or into porn,” says Durvasula. “Male sexuality hasn’t been fetishized and eroticized in the same way, and so it becomes easier to joke about it.”\n",

      "Male nudity can also make people uncomfortable, which means that they’re more likely to laugh at it. “Little girls don’t sneak off with naked pictures of men, the way little boys do with women,” says Durvasula. “It means that the visual image of female nudity has more power from an early age.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick agrees that we’re not totally at ease with 100 percent male nudity. Images of shirtless guys are common, but it’s still pretty rare to see photos of men naked from the waist down — and it can be especially jarring for heterosexual men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It forces men to view other men as sexualized, something that they are not used to doing, and to engage in direct comparison with another man, which can raise concerns over how their penis size and physique compare,” Frederick explains. “Some people tie together masculinity and penis size, so these comparisons affect not just men’s feelings about their body, but also their feelings about their masculinity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the photos of Bloom may also arouse emotion for women, Frederick says. The photos “feature an attractive man, but one whom women feel some personal connection to, because they have seen him in movies and interviews for over a decade. The photos feature him mostly nude, but with his genitals obscured, leaving something to the realm of fantasy and imagination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, cue the excitement and jokes, quite apart from the fact that Bloom’s privacy was violated. We’re seeing this reaction on social media “because there is less judgment about his morality or purity,” says Frederick.\n",
