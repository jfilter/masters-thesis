Usually they don't play that bad which means the timing was off and that is mostly due to him taking the ball under center instead of in the shotgun.

Or is that what the Paris Haunted Mansion/Phantom Manor looks like?   \n",

If it was such a gigantic factor in the SB run, as some make it out to be, it would have resulted in some points on the board! Let's face facts, he wasn't great at the end of his career and the D basically handed him another ring. If you want to argue that his presence played a motivational factor for the rest of the team, you may have a point (guys definitely wanted to send him out on top), but the whole pre-snap things loses a lot of its effectiveness when the opposing defense has no respect for the passing game.   \n",

It a team and sometimes you play bad because the people around you. The offense was not that good overall protecting any of the QBs. Another thing is the opposing team didn't have to worry about the passing game because Kubiak was using a running scheme. My question to you is who is your real team because you obviously don't know much about the Broncos. What are you a KC or Patriots fan? Why do you feel the need to attack Manning or troll Broncos articles? Move along he is retired and get over it.   \n",

You have a valid point about the o-line, but that doesn't fully explain xxnumber TDs the entire year vs. xxnumber interceptions (not even close). The offense was terrible, and Peyton's decline was a large part of that. Anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. Oh and one look at my posting history should show you what teams I am a fan of.   \n",
       "7892  Yeah I guess it doesn't explain he didn't actually play a full year and that they were doing a run offense instead of a shotgun pass offense before he got to hurt to play. When he came back they actually went to what they call a pistol offense and he did better but it cut down his time to throw. He actually could only do quick throws. If you notice in some of those games Kubiak just let him play his game and he won them. The San Diego game is a example. They were about to lose home field advantage and they switched back to the shotgun and he tore them a part. He played injured due to his age he couldn't recover quick I'll give you that but like I said his o-line was not that great last year and the receivers were dropping balls like crazy. Usually they don't play that bad which means the timing was off and that is mostly due to him taking the ball under center instead of in the shotgun. It just the way he plays but as Kubiak showed if they slowed the game down the defense would dom...   \n",

I think that people are saying all this wonderful stuff about him just because he died. It seems like everybody in show biz who wasn't a big deal has everyone praising them just because they died.   \n",

I'm pretty sure she doesn't know that resisting is a misdemeanor, but then again, this wasn't an arrest. Easier to understand when an adult gets arrested and knows not to #$%$ off the cops. It's completely different to a child that feels she is not wrong, even though she probably was and then grabbed to be escorted out. It is terrifying and panic-inducing.

Given that a pet rock should be able to beat Trump in any reasonable election, it's kind of amazing to see the Cruz campaign making such poor decisions — and it's surprising that the Republicans rallying around Lucifer incarnate (aka the Zodiac Killer) aren't offering him better campaign advice.\\n\\nThere are a lot of theories as to why the flailing campaign thinks Fiorina can resuscitate it, most obvious of which being that Fiorina is going to appeal to women voters, which is sexist, insulting, obnoxious, and reminiscent of Sarah Palin in 2008. Women are in fact smart people who don't actually vote solely on the basis of a candidate's gender, and the same people who didn't vote for Palin are likely the same people who aren't going to be casting votes for a ticket with Fiorina on it — because those people believe that issues trump gender.\\n\\n...</td>\n",

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing for Portugal against Germany, Pepe walked away, leaving Thomas Müller on the ground, a victim of the sport’s frequent and unavoidable collisions. Pepe’s heart, very possibly full of concern for the welfare of a fallen compatriot, returned to where Müller sat and leaned down, not so much to offer a helping hand as to head-butt Müller with all of his might.\\n\\nPepe was subsequently red-carded and his team lost 0-4, but his point had been made: There would be no dirtier player in soccer in the known universe. Not if he could help it, and he most certainly could. You see, in a history that could just as easily be the history of the red card — a penalty designator for those not familiar wit...   \n",
