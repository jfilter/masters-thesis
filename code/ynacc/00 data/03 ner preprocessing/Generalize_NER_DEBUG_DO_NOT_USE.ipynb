      "It all boils down to a simple question:    If you are happy with the globalism that has infected our nation on countless levels with New World Order establishment favorites like HW Bush, Bill, W Bush and Obama the past 24 years and want to further erode America, choose Hillary, Ted Cruz or John Kasich who are all more of the same controlled puppets of the elite banks and world power players who only care about making more money and gaining more power for themselves.   If you want something different, like a non-politician who has not been purchased by the globalists and who pledges to put America first and defend our culture, heritage and prevent the globalist-funded third world invasion of our homeland, vote TRUMP.  It is a vote of civilizational proportions.  Leftism has infected Europe to the point that they are allowing themselves to be conquered by an invading army of Muslims who cannot assimilate and don't belong there.  Europe as the right to remain European and yet they now live in fear 100% of the time because savages could blow themselves up anywhere and at anytime.  If you want don't want that way of life here, VOTE TRUMP.\n"
