       "'Cop, out.\\n\\nSeries co-lead Stana Katic will not be a part of Castle Season 9, the victim of a cast shake-up that reportedly is designed to help cut costs for the aging procedural.\\n\\nSources confirm for TVLine that which our sister site Deadline first reported, that Katic, whose one-year extension has expired, was not asked back for the fall (in the event the series gets renewed). Nor will longtime cast member Tamala Jones return as M.E. Lanie Parish.\\n\\nIn a statement on the situation, Katic said, “Rather then distract from what was an amazing experience, I would just like to say that I’m very grateful to ABC for giving me the opportunity to be a part of a much beloved show. Thank you to the fans.”\\n\\nUPDATE: The following day, Katic also directed this message at fans:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/Stana_Katic/status/722492283082256385\\n\\nABC has confirmed both actresses’ exits, and issued this statement: “Kate Beckett has been a beloved character on our hit series Castle for the past eight years. We are grateful for Stana Katic’s talent and dedication to the series and we hope to continue our relationship. Tamala Jones has also been an integral part of the series and we are grateful she was a part of Castle.“\\n\\nHow might Beckett be written out? In a new interview with TVLine, co-showrunner Alexi Hawley said that with both Katic’s and Nathan Fillion’s contracts up, the Season 8 finale airing May 16 ends “in a very dynamic way which leaves open the possibility that maybe the show won’t come back in the same form.” In that season ender, titled “Crossfire,” a twist in Rick and Kate’s final pursuit of the high-powered drug lord known as LokSat “puts their case — and their lives —in jeopardy,” seemingly allowing the series the option to kill off the intrepid NYPD police captain.\\n\\nBack in January, then-ABC president Paul Lee confirmed for TVLine that some “good ideas” were being bandied about with regard to extending Castle’s longevity, possibly via a modified premise.\\n\\nHow do you think Kate will be written out of the series for Season 9?\\n\\n'"
