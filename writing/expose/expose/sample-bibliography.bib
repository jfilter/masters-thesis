This paper presents findings from our exploratory, interdisciplinary study in journalism research and computer science that focuses on the algorithmic classification and clustering of user comments. In contrast to endeavours that aim at filtering out hate speech or spam, we take a more constructive approach and focus on detecting particularly useful or highquality user contributions that can be leveraged for journalistic purposes. On the basis of a literature review and our own preliminary research on audience participation and user review analytics, we developed a mock-up of a software framework to help journalists systematically analyze user comments to this end. We then surveyed its effectiveness through two group discussions – one with comment moderators and another with editors from different editorial departments of a large German online newsroom. Features that journalists and comment moderators considered useful include the categorization of user comments in pro- and contra-arguments towards a certain topic, the automated assessment of comments' quality as well as the identification of surprising or exceptional comments and those that present new questions, arguments or viewpoints.},

	abstract = {Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety of tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or only apply single granular (wordby-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model. Given two sentences P and Q, our model ﬁrst encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two encoded sentences in two directions P against Q and Q against P . In each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all timesteps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a ﬁxed-length matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, a decision is made through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks: paraphrase identiﬁcation, natural language inference and answer sentence selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.},

By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and ﬁnd that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we signiﬁcantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CONLL03 shared task.},

We report on classiﬁcation results, where the problems to solve and the data to work with come from a commercial enterprise. In this context typical for NLP research, we discuss relevant industrial aspects.

	abstract = {Contextual word representations derived from pre-trained bidirectional language models (biLMs) have recently been shown to provide signiﬁcant improvements to the state of the art for a wide range of NLP tasks. However, many questions remain as to how and why these models are so effective. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical study of how the choice of neural architecture (e.g. LSTM, CNN, or self attention) inﬂuences both end task accuracy and qualitative properties of the representations that are learned. We show there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, but all architectures learn high quality contextual representations that outperform word embeddings for four challenging NLP tasks. Additionally, all architectures learn representations that vary with network depth, from exclusively morphological based at the word embedding layer through local syntax based in the lower contextual layers to longer range semantics such coreference at the upper layers. Together, these results suggest that unsupervised biLMs, independent of architecture, are learning much more about the structure of language than previously appreciated.},
