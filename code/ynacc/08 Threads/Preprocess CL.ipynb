If you notice in some of those games Kubiak just let him play his game and he won them. The San Diego game is a example. They were about to lose home field advantage and they switched back to the shotgun and he tore them a part. He played injured due to his age he couldn't recover quick I'll give you that but like I said his o-line was not that great last year and the receivers were dropping balls like crazy.

Or is that what the Paris Haunted Mansion/Phantom Manor looks like?   \n",

Cheating is one thing, but obviously this lady is sick. He needs to leave her. I could see maybe trying to work it out if it were just the cheating alone and one time thing, but she is disgusting sleeping with a teenage student. Also factor in that she was cheating on him while engaged and newlyweds. A stray down the road can be forgiven, but she was doing this from the beginning. Hopefully he wises up and leaves her.   \n",

From the story, apart from the boy's age, I can't see how to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the female teacher is the villain, and not the victim. Honestly speaking, a sixteen year boy really well capable of many vices, and cannot be always assumed to be innocent.   \n",

       "22    @USERNAME - I live in the real world with laws. I have also taught HS and worked part time as a Sheriff's deputy. One of my favorite stories involves one of my students being brought in one weekend for minor consumption. Yes teenagers do make stupid decisions, I did when I was a teenager. That does not in any way excuses the behavior. Children are not good decision makers, they do not have the mental capacity yet to fully understand. Studies have shown that. Around xxnumber or so the brains is more fully developed. That is why they are considered to be minors and protected under the law until xxnumber . They cannot consent to sex (though yes many do). They also cannot sign legally binding contracts. Should you sell your car to a xxnumber year old and the xxnumber year old signs the contract, then the kid drives away and totals the car, they can walk back to you and demand (and receive) a full refund and tell you to go get the car. The contract is not valid. In this case, the teache...   \n",

I support justice but in this case I feel she is using the society been more lenient towards women to fulfill her selfish acts! as there is no evidence to show, all she is doing is just blabbing. Sadly I've seen and heard of a few ladies who lie on a man just to get their selfish gains because usually the society is more sympathetic towards women and every man is automatically a criminal especially if the lady is good at shedding crocodile tears. very very sad!   \n",

If it was such a gigantic factor in the SB run, as some make it out to be, it would have resulted in some points on the board! Let's face facts, he wasn't great at the end of his career and the D basically handed him another ring. If you want to argue that his presence played a motivational factor for the rest of the team, you may have a point (guys definitely wanted to send him out on top), but the whole pre-snap things loses a lot of its effectiveness when the opposing defense has no respect for the passing game.   \n",

It a team and sometimes you play bad because the people around you. The offense was not that good overall protecting any of the QBs. Another thing is the opposing team didn't have to worry about the passing game because Kubiak was using a running scheme. My question to you is who is your real team because you obviously don't know much about the Broncos. What are you a KC or Patriots fan? Why do you feel the need to attack Manning or troll Broncos articles? Move along he is retired and get over it.   \n",

You have a valid point about the o-line, but that doesn't fully explain xxnumber TDs the entire year vs. xxnumber interceptions (not even close). The offense was terrible, and Peyton's decline was a large part of that. Anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. Oh and one look at my posting history should show you what teams I am a fan of.   \n",
       "7892  Yeah I guess it doesn't explain he didn't actually play a full year and that they were doing a run offense instead of a shotgun pass offense before he got to hurt to play. When he came back they actually went to what they call a pistol offense and he did better but it cut down his time to throw. He actually could only do quick throws. If you notice in some of those games Kubiak just let him play his game and he won them. The San Diego game is a example. They were about to lose home field advantage and they switched back to the shotgun and he tore them a part. He played injured due to his age he couldn't recover quick I'll give you that but like I said his o-line was not that great last year and the receivers were dropping balls like crazy. Usually they don't play that bad which means the timing was off and that is mostly due to him taking the ball under center instead of in the shotgun. It just the way he plays but as Kubiak showed if they slowed the game down the defense would dom...   \n",

He had a show on TV in the early xxnumber s and the show sucked. He wasn't funny. I don't know he made a career in comedy. I think that people are saying all this wonderful stuff about him just because he died. It seems like everybody in show biz who wasn't a big deal has everyone praising them just because they died.   \n",

Most women that became teachers were usually strict moral beings. It has always been men who have struggled thinking with the small head versus using the big head. It is just a sham, how sluttish these young female teachers have become, with no morale guidance or self discipline.   \n",

       "2    But, the genders are important. The penalty for the crime should be related to any damage done. In the case of a female teacher and a male student less damage is done. If one of my high school teachers hit on me I would have said yes right away. If I found out one of my male friends was doing, a teacher I would have high-fived him. Yes, she has issues. But, a double standard exist because men and women are different. You can act like it's the same thing all day if you want, but that doesn't make it true. Males just want to have sex. Next time you watch some reality cop show just note how many men get caught, and arrested, for soliciting a prostitute verses women. I absolutely guarantee the ratio is xxnumber , xxnumber to xxnumber or even greater. This is even though men know that prostitutes carry diseases, soliciting a prostitute is illegal, you are paying for sex and it's devoid of any genuine intimacy. Men just want to have sex.   \n",

When the supposed victim high-fives the jury as the teacher testifies what dirty little acts they engaged in, the jury tends to not find the teacher very guilty.   \n",

You often heard of male teachers involved with female students, and as should be they were arrested and prosecuted. The fact that the predator is a female and victim is male should have no significance on prosecuting the crime, and implementing the sentence. This woman should be prosecuted for the felony sexual assault she committed, and be sentenced according to what the crime dictates, prison time as well as registering as a sex offender. The only way this type of behavior will stop is to aggressively prosecute these cases. This woman was one sick puppy. Having sex with a minor just prior to her wedding, and texting nude selfies to a minor while on honeymoon. Why engage in the hypocrisy of getting married????   \n",

Misogeny is a mental illness, and the mouth foaming, lying, smearing, vile, evil, animalistically vicious nuts who believe in their 'kind, loving' God of bloodlust and vengeance want to dictate how YOUR life is lived. It won't stop at LGBTs.   \n",

The bible recounts God's divine intervention on behalf of His creation xxnumber years ago. To compare God to Santa Claus is like comparing a ten speed bike to a Ferrari. xxnumber ) Acknowledging the existence of God does not = Christian. xxnumber ) The objective of the Christian faith isn't the moral excellence of the individual. Christ died for sinners not the morally excellent. If this is how this husband and wide convey the Christian faith to their child - she will never understand the true essence of it.   \n",

It's each persons responsibility to know what the boundaries of their current relationship is and to not go past them. If a woman is in a supposedly monogamous relationship, it is her responsibility not to sleep with other people. If a man is in a supposedly monogamous relationship, it is his responsibility not to sleep with other people. It really is that simple.   \n",

Grew up playing all the original CODs, with COD xxnumber being my favorite, and no kiddies thats not cod MWF xxnumber or COD black opsII, just regular old Call of Duty xxnumber . This stuff is just pathetic these days and I refuse to buy another one of their games. When they were doing one game every two years, thats when they were making gems. Get back to the historical wars, we have been in modern for last xxnumber games or so. Also, Brothers in Arms was a great game! used to be Number xxnumber in the world at that game behind SWKenobi. lol   \n",

No where to be found, I guess better late than never. ( LOL) Obama's entire administration has been missing in action.
