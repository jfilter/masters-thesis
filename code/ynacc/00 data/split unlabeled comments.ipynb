Except, if he had NOT stolen a guitar, then he would not have HAD to post bail to begin with. He was not in jail for \"being poor\"....he was there for theft, and rightly so. Next, liberals will say that \"stealing is not a capital crime\"...but he was not \"executed\" for stealing. In fact, he had not even been convicted. He was killed by a couple of other thugs - probably for \"dissing\" them. Yes, this is a tragic situation. No, he should not be dead. However, he is solely responsible for being in the position where he was in jail to begin with. Jails are not happy places - and they are not supposed to be.

Why did she think Wisconsin people would be receptive to her?
