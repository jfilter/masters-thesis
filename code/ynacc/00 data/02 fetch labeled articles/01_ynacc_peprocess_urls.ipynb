      "A man in Harris County, Texas, was beaten to death in a jail cell on April 5 less than 48 hours after failing to post bail, authorities told the Houston Press. Patrick Joseph Brown, 46, was booked on a misdemeanor theft charge on April 3 for allegedly stealing a guitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, Brown was denied a personal bond at his hearing and asked to pay $3,000 to walk free — an amount he could not afford. He was then sent to the Harris County Jail to await trial. Less than 48 hours later, he was found unresponsive in the holding cell he'd shared with several other men, including Curtis Maxwell and Ebenezer Nah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maxwell and Nah had beaten Brown to within an inch of his life. He was pronounced dead at nearby Memorial Hermann Hospital soon after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Google Maps\n",
      "\n",
      "All three men were reportedly booked on either April 2 or 3, meaning they'd been in the jail together three days at most. Maxwell and Nah have both been charged with aggravated assault causing seriously bodily injury, Harris County Sheriff's spokesman Ryan Sullivan told the Press last Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still unclear what caused the dispute that led to Brown's murder, but according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, homicide is a rare cause of death in local jails — lagging far behind illness and suicide, the two leading causes. Nevertheless, the 46-year-old's exposure to factors that led to his demise remain a stark reminder of the consequences America's criminal justice system holds for those who can't shoulder its financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "In places like Harris County, Ferguson, Missouri, Montgomery, Alabama, and elsewhere, poor people easily get ensnared in a cycle of debt and incarceration, as their inability to pay fees stemming from minor offenses incur increasingly more financial, and legal, penalties. The result is a system where being poor becomes a de facto crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, guards are supposed to check on inmates at the Harris County Jail every 15 minutes, and it was during one of these checks that Brown's prone body was discovered. One of Brown's former girlfriends told the Houston Chronicle that he left behind a teenage son, who is devastated by the loss of his father.\n",

      "The Dirtiest Soccer Player in the Known Universe\n",
      "Because never does a man stand so tall as when he stoops to stomp on the hand of a man in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a twisted delight to be had in watching Real Madrid’s oft-injured central defender sensation, Képler Laveran Lima Ferreira, or Pepe, do what he does best. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing for Portugal against Germany, Pepe walked away, leaving Thomas Müller on the ground, a victim of the sport’s frequent and unavoidable collisions. Pepe’s heart, very possibly full of concern for the welfare of a fallen compatriot, returned to where Müller sat and leaned down, not so much to offer a helping hand as to head-butt Müller with all of his might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pepe was subsequently red-carded and his team lost 0-4, but his point had been made: There would be no dirtier player in soccer in the known universe. Not if he could help it, and he most certainly could. You see, in a history that could just as easily be the history of the red card — a penalty designator for those not familiar with the rules of the “gentle sport” — the Brazilian Pepe cuts a dirty swath across the playing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tactics have ranged from stomping on the hand of a downed Lionel Messi in 2012 — unintentionally, Pepe claimed — to his 2009 pièce de résistance: knocking down an opposing midfielder in the penalty area, then kicking the fallen opponent twice before being yanked away from him, only to return to push his head into the field while stomping on him. Pepe then proceeded to punch another player in the face. All in a day’s work.\n",
      "\n",
      "His reward? A 10-game season-ending ban. His response? Probably very much like it was in a 2012 incident where Pepe braced a ref in the locker room, calling him “a rip-off motherfucker.” Suspension in that case? Two games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guys like this are typically adored by the home supporters but furiously hated by the rest,” says Kristian Dávid, an 18-year vet of the game (striker and sometime left winger) and a coach for Swedish teams. “But in general, guys like Pepe are good to have, to be honest. Just to be able to get your opponents off-balance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Pepe (whose management declined to make him available for comment) joins a rogues’ gallery that includes 27-year-old Diego Costa (the “most disliked man in football,” according to British press), Zlatan Ibrahimović (kicked a teammate in the face while the teammate was being interviewed on-camera) and Hall of Famer Vinnie Jones, who has since gone on to a film career. Jones’ usual roles? Guys who beat other guys to bits, naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not so much the fact that these guys are just fucking shit up that I like,” says Kevin Conahan, a radio DJ and 18-year soccer vet. “Well, actually, it is that.” That, and probably that anyone willing to play a long-haul game like soccer as though it’s a life-and-death endeavor, deserves being paid attention to.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexandra Judd was working at Zada Janes in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday, when she claims that two patrons left her a bible verse on the tip line of their bill instead of cash — followed by a note at the bottom that says \"praying for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The customer wrote \"Leviticus 20:13,\" which reads, \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Judd, who is gay, posted a censored photo of the bill to Facebook, which blocked out the customer's name and credit card info.\n",
      "\n",

      "Do Aliens Exist? Here's What Scientists Say About Life on Other Planets\n",
      "Humans have always wondered about life beyond the stars. The curiosity doesn't only stem from popular culture and the advent of film and television, but even before then. Books, oral stories and painting depicted \"evidence\" of aliens. People have always thought about extraterrestrial life, what aliens would look like, and if the creatures would come in peace, if they exist. But what are the nation's scientists and researchers saying about the potential existence of aliens?\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA's administrator believes we are not alone. In 2015, Charles Bolden, who has been the administrator of NASA since 2009, said, \"I do believe that we will someday find other forms of life or a form of life, if not in our solar system then in some of the other solar systems — the billions of solar systems in the universe,\" according to the Telegraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why 7 Experts Are Convinced Alien Life Might Really Exist\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today we know that there are literally thousands, if not millions of other planets, many of which may be very similar to our own earth,\" the 69-year-old former astronaut continued. \"So some of us, many of us believe that we're going to find ... evidence that there is life elsewhere in the universe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the History Channel, Frank Drake, a notable astronomer, created an equation that was able to \"estimate the likelihood of the existence of alien life, taking into account a number of factors including the average number of planets able to support life and the fraction that could go on to support intelligent life.\" The equation found that \"hundreds of thousands\" of planets that could support extraterrestrial beings could (and should) exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why haven't they contacted us? There are several hypotheses that try to explain why aliens haven't reached out to Earthlings. One theory, titled the \"Zoo hypothesis,\" posits that aliens are actually preventing us from contacting them, so that the extraterrestrial beings don't interrupt our natural development. In short, Earth might be a \"zoo\" for aliens, to watch our growth as a species.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fermi Paradox is multi-layered, but a branch of the theory known as the Rare Earth Hypothesis essentially posits that humanity is the only species to have made it through the \"Great Filter,\" a set of circumstances that make life possible, such as living on a planet that is just close enough to the Sun, or having just the right set of evolutionary events occur to create life. The Rare Earth Hypothesis believes that these set of circumstances are so infinitesimally small, that no other life in the universe is able to replicate it. Humanity won the cosmic lottery!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no way to know for sure if aliens exist or not, that is until we are contacted. This could be dangerous and we should be cautious of alien life, Stephen Hawking, one of the world's leading minds on the cosmos, warns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare,\" the 74-year-old physicist said at the 50th anniversary celebration of NASA in 2008, according to the Daily Galaxy. \"Some would say it has yet to occur on earth. We should be careful if we ever happen upon extraterrestrial life. Watch out if you would meet an alien. You could be infected with a disease with which you have no resistance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But finding alien life would be a monumental step for science. Finding out that we aren't alone out there, and there are extraterrestrial beings attempting to contact humanity, opens a world of possibilities and a variety of questions. What do aliens know? What can aliens teach us? How would we interact with beings from space?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just imagine the moment, when we find potential signatures of life,\" Matt Mountain, director and James Webb telescope scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said at a seminar in NASA's headquarters in 2014. \"Imagine the moment when the world wakes up and the human race realizes that its long loneliness in time and space may be over — the possibility we're no longer alone in the universe.\"\n",

      "Cellphone video of a transgender woman being physically and verbally assaulted on New York City's No. 4 train was posted to Facebook on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recording, taken on April 28 by transgender woman Pearl Love, opens with another passenger on the train taunting Pearl about her makeup, handbag and feminine presentation. \"Suck my dick!\" the passenger screams before declaring that Pearl's presence \"ain't appropriate for my child.\" The recording ends with the assailant jumping out of her seat and striking Pearl, who then stops the recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she goes by Pearl Love on Facebook, Pearl, a Taiwanese transgender woman, told Mic she just goes by the first name. Pearl confirmed the authenticity of the video and said she was on the way to New York City's LGBT Community Center when the female passenger began to berate her. After five minutes of verbal harassment, Pearl said she began to record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl said she experiences harassment in public so frequently that at first she didn't find the assault out of the ordinary. \"It happens all the time basically,\" Pearl said. \"I just walk away mostly, or I go to other room or other subway.\" This is the first time Pearl has recorded an incident of harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it wasn't until after Pearl posted the video on Facebook and received an outpouring of support that she realized how terrible the ordeal had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know that it was that serious until people told me, because I've gotten used to it,\" Pearl said. \"I thought, 'Oh, it was just another woman.' I didn't know until people told me that it was not right, that it was assault because it's happened for so long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides attacking Pearl for her gender identity, the woman in the video hurled ethnic slurs at Pearl, who is Taiwanese.\n",

      "As the video progresses, the woman morphs from irritated to angry to violent. She strikes Pearl, who remains silent throughout the recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl said she stopped the recording at that point, but says she has two other videos showing the woman chasing her around the subway car. Pearl said she has chosen not to make the two other recordings public for the time being because she found the response to the first so overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl said that she has been moved by the outpouring of supportive comments from people on Facebook:\n",

      "She said that assault was just one of the struggles she faces as a transgender woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just a really small thing that I face every day. I go to a job interview, they look at me like, 'You're never going to get a job,'\" she said. \"They never even waste your time asking anything about you when you look feminine.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I cannot go anywhere without the subway. What am I gonna do?\" she said. \"I go on the subway, I usually just don't look at anyone, I just sit and pretend I'm studying or whatever.

      "\n",
      "Even though it's 2016, women are still routinely humiliated and treated dismissively by health care providers, from doctors to pharmacists. On Thursday, a 19-year-old student who goes by momdadimrae on Reddit went to the gynecologist, where she was subjected to a slew of snide remarks after she told him she struggled with depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went to the gynecologist for the first time for an IUD consultation. In the span of 20 minutes, he belittled me for being on antidepressants since 14, told me that depression doesn't exist and I should stop whining, and yelled a nurse out of the room,\" momdadimrae wrote on Reddit. \"He kept berating me, asking me if it was school or home that made me sad and seek attention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her horror story about this sexist doctor quickly went viral, garnering hundreds of comments. Outraged users encouraged momdadimrae to report the doctor for misconduct, to which she enthusiastically replied \"I am definitely going to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, momdadimrae is not alone. Reddit is full of women sharing horror stories about their shoddy treatment at the hands of medical professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she asked to remain anonymous, momdadimrae said this was not her first experience being shamed by a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I started taking oral contraceptives when I was 16, and I had to see 3 different doctors before one would give me a prescription,\" she said in an email interview, \"because the general attitude amongst the doctors I had seen was, 'You are too immature to handle birth control.' ... Their reasoning was that I was only 16 so I shouldn't be worrying about sex and things like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until she saw a female doctor that momdadimrae finally got a prescription. (It's worth noting that in Canada, there is no minimum age for prescribing birth control; the decision is largely left up to the physicians themselves.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another user, mintcakefrog, replied to momdadimrae's story with her own humiliating experience getting an IUD. After she told the gynecologist she had stayed in a mental hospital, the doctor reportedly called in mintcakefrog's partner and \"proceeded to talk to him and asked if I was able to consent and explained the procedure to me like I was 5 years old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it's not just female patients with a history of mental health issues who are shamed by physicians. Other female patients have reported being slut-shamed by their gynecologists, including 21-year-old Reddit user ssaen, whose story went viral last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"[My OB-GYN] starts by telling me that healthy sex is between two virgins in the 'lifetime-commitment of marriage.' Obviously, she knows that I am not a virgin, and tells me that I can still make the decision to abstain from sex until I am married,\" ssaen wrote. Hundreds of women replied to this post with their own horror stories. \"I specifically asked for annual pelvics when he didn't bring it up ... He then insisted I wouldn't need them, since I wasn't married,\" commenter AptCasaNova described her experience with a male doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If nothing else, the response to momdadirae's story taught her that \"there definitely needs to be a change in how women are treated by health care professionals,\" she said in the email interview. \"I have had many doctors tell me that I should steer clear of an IUD because I might want a baby in a few months. I'm 19 years old! I have the right to make informed decisions about my body and my reproductive organs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the experiences of women on Reddit make clear, it's not momdadimrae's age that makes doctors feel they have the right to question her reproductive health choices. It's also her gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When a woman says a man has done something unacceptable to her, the first question needs to be, 'How can I help you deal with this?', rather than 'Are you sure that's really what happened?'\" she said. \"Women need to be taken seriously.\"\n"

In doing so, he pointed out that “climate change is not a liberal vs. conservative thing, but the people who profit from ignoring it want you to believe it is,” before running a PSA featuring real, actual scientists to state, for once and for all: We’re not f*cking with you.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Thwarting a Kansas group comprised of parents and students that opposed the state’s adoption of a national science curriculum, a federal court has upheld a lower court’s ruling on a case involving the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Back in 2013, the Citizens for Objective Public Education (COPE), a religiously oriented group, sued to block the curriculum, claiming that the new standards constituted a form of “religious indoctrination.” According to COPE, NGSS’s failure to include a religious basis for the origins of life and the universe makes the curriculum unsuitable for the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "COPE’s lawsuit hinged upon the notion that the scientific view promoted by the NGSS curriculum is tacitly anti-religious, thereby violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. By not mentioning God’s involvement in the beginning of mankind, COPE says, Kansas schools are instead advancing a non-religious standard, “establishing” a non-religion. The Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, however, rejected this claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“COPE does not offer any facts to support the conclusion that the Standards condemn any religion or send a message of endorsement,” the court concluded. “And any fear of biased instruction is premised on COPE’s predictions of school districts’ responses to the Standards — an attempt by COPE to recast a future injury as a present one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal court also noted that a previous Supreme Court decision doled out in 1987 in Edwards v. Aguillard eliminated the need to teach creationism in classrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "NGSS has already been implemented in 18 states (including Kansas), and draws support from numerous national organizations, including the National Research Council, National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n",

      "When McCrory had to defend HB2, which requires people in North Carolina to use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth rather than their gender identity, he veered off topic and said this was a problem caused by the left and not the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly next debunked claims that HB2 promotes children's safety. After she called misconceptions about transgender people as predators \"not true,\" she again asked McCrory, \"What is your fear?\"\n",

      "\"Typically male molesters are heterosexual, and if they want to sneak into a bathroom they'll do it,\" Kelly said. \"But 90% of the cases, molestation happens with someone you know. So what is the fear with the transgender situation in the bathrooms?\"\n",

      "Darkness to Light, a sexual abuse advocacy group, corroborates Kelly's statistic — 90% of child sexual abuse happens with someone the family knows or trusts.\n",

      "McCrory finally answered Kelly's \"fear\" question and said families have a \"basic expectation of privacy\" when it comes to their children using a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if privacy or security is McCrory's concern, HB2 doesn't seem to be the way to achieve it.

      "The questions have come up before: Why isn't there a White History Month? Why isn't there a network for White Entertainment Television, like BET? Black Girls Rock? What about White Girls Rock? What about the critically acclaimed Broadway play Hamilton's call for nonwhite actors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, these few examples demonstrate \"reverse racism,\" or the discrimination against members of a dominant racial group. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things like BET, Black Girls Rock or Black History Month are not reverse racist against white people,\" Zeba Blay, a Huffington Post Black Voices writer, illustrates in a video. \"Because remember, in a society where white is seen as the default race, all history is white history. But racism isn't just someone feeling superior to another race and then discriminating against them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism and prejudice aren't quite the same thing. Racism, rather, is best known as a system in which a racial majority is able to enforce its power and privilege over another race through political, economic and institutional means. Therefore racism can be described as \"prejudice plus power,\" as the two work together to create the system of inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be guilty of racism, however, to be a racist, say the revision proponents, one must have power, and power of a special sort,\" Carlos Hoyt Jr, who is an assistant professor of social work at Wheelock College, wrote in The Pedagogy of the Meaning of Racism of those who would like to change the dictionary definition of racism. \"For the revisionists, racism is prejudice plus power leveraged at an institutional level to maintain the privileges of the dominant social group.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, when the term \"reverse racism\" is brought up, it is in response to a slight that a member of the dominant group perceives has happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in reality, the United States has a long legacy of racism that makes it difficult for people of color to receive quality health care, access affordable housing, find stable employment and avoid getting wrapped up in the justice system.

      "Earlier this month, the court determined that all charges against Stalvey's biological mother would be dropped if she completed therapeutic trainings, community service and paid a fine.

      "\n",
      "But after examining Sunday’s events more closely, a government minister on Thursday speculated that rather than a drone, the object may have actually been a plastic bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there’ve been hundreds of apparent near misses between planes and drones over the last couple of years, initial news reports regarding the recent Heathrow incident suggested an actual collision had taken place for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aircraft, a British Airways Airbus A320 with 132 passengers on board, landed safely. The pilot had said that as the plane came in on its final approach, it hit what may have been a drone flying at an altitude of about 1,700 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a search on the ground failed to turn up any debris, government minister Robert Goodwill appeared keen to play down the incident, urging other officials not to overreact with calls for swift legislation to further tighten rules on drone use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill told a government committee it wasn’t certain that a drone strike had taken place, adding that there’s “some speculation that it may have even been a plastic bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister also said that “early reports of a dent in the front of the plane” appeared to be inaccurate as “no actual damage” was found during an inspection of the aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, such incidents can happen in the blink of an eye, so it’s highly likely that a portion of near misses reported as drone related could in fact be other objects such as birds, balloons, or indeed plastic shopping bags floating about the sky on a gusty day.\n",

      "In reality, scientific evidence that cigarettes cause cancer was becoming overwhelming. In 1964, the Surgeon General seemed to put an end to any controversy when he released the report of an independent advisory committee that had considered more than 7,000 published articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Surgeon General’s warning had a profound effect on the public, prompting many smokers to quit. But the tobacco companies and their scientists would continue to deny that cigarettes cause cancer for another 35 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "To discourage smokers from quitting, companies redesigned their cigarettes to seem safer. First, they added filters. Then they introduced “low-tar” cigarettes. Within a few years, these cigarettes dominated the market. Marlboro Lights, which debuted in 1971, became the nation’s best-selling cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tobacco companies knew from extensive internal research that smokers were addicted to nicotine and needed a certain amount of it every day to satisfy their habit. Given a “low-tar” cigarette, they would change the way they smoked to get their fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the passage of a new law, the Federal Trade Commission in 1967 began testing all cigarette brands on special smoking machines that measured the amount of tar inhaled. Cigarettes were reformulated, not so much to reduce tar but to fool the machines, according to a National Cancer Institute report. Tiny holes were cut in the cigarette paper to vent tar when a cigarette was smoked by a machine. Those holes, however, didn’t reduce the tar inhaled by smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you reduce the amount of nicotine coming through, the person changes a pattern of it. They take bigger puffs, they take deeper puffs, they take longer puffs, they smoke more cigarettes per day to get the amount of nicotine they are seeking to satisfy their addiction,” said Dr. David Burns, a retired medical professor at the University of California, San Diego, who edited some of the Surgeon General’s reports on smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns was testifying for the plaintiffs in a recent St. Louis class-action trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also testifying was William Farone, the research director at Philip Morris from 1977 to 1984. He said studies done at the company even before he was hired showed that smokers who switched to light cigarettes would take deeper puffs to get the same amount of nicotine they’d received from regular ones. Farone said other than those tiny holes in the paper, the differences between a Marlboro Red and a Marlboro Light were small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public-health scientists would not figure this out for several more years. A study by the American Cancer Society published in 1995 found that the rate of lung cancer deaths among 200,000 smokers actually went up after light cigarettes began dominating sales. Experts believe that the low-burning temperature of a low-tar cigarette and deeper puffs by smokers allow more carcinogens to go deeper into the lungs.\n",

      "‘Corrective statements’ ordered\n",
      "\n",
      "The rewards for disputing the scientific consensus are high while the risks are low. The Justice Department’s racketeering lawsuit had sought to have the tobacco industry repay illegal profits of $480 billion. But an appellate court ruled that federal racketeering laws didn’t allow for fines for past behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Kessler’s only power was to order cigarette makers to stop engaging in illegal behavior. Companies appealed her order to quit making claims about low-tar cigarettes, arguing it violated their First Amendment rights. But Kessler’s ruling was upheld.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Philip Morris hired scientists from the consulting firms Gradient Corp. and Ramboll Environ to testify in lawsuits that so-called low-tar cigarettes are safer than regular ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharon Eubanks, the former Justice Department attorney who led the lawsuit, believes Philip Morris is violating Kessler’s order. The order forbids public statements declaring that low-tar cigarettes have health benefits, even if such statements come from a Philip Morris consultant.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enforce the order, the Justice Department would have to file a motion with Kessler. A department spokesman would not comment on the case. Calls to Philip Morris seeking comment were not returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the case wound through appeals, Kessler issued a revised opinion and order in February reiterating that tobacco companies must make the following “corrective statements” on their websites and in advertising:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many smokers switch to low-tar and light cigarettes rather than quitting because they think low-tar and light cigarettes are less harmful. They are not .\n",
      "\n",
      ". “Low tar” and “light” cigarette smokers inhale essentially the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "All cigarettes cause cancer, lung disease, heart attacks, and premature death — lights, low tar, ultra lights, and naturals. There is no safe cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "A decade after the original order, and five years after Kessler first issued these statements, tobacco companies are still appealing her ruling. None has printed the statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress agreed with Kessler’s original findings, and in 2009 passed a law also forbidding the tobacco companies from calling cigarettes “light” or “low-tar” without the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But Philip Morris says research done since Kessler’s 2006 order justifies the company’s claims that such cigarettes are safer than regular ones.\n"

No wife, no kids, no hobbies, same job, same apartment… Nothing changes with you.”\n",

      "“I feel like my life is a charade,” Tony laments. Recounting how he got easily swindled by “Leah,” he asks Tim, “You’d tell me, right, if I was losing my edge, the DiNozzo edge? Because I feel like it.” Worse, he feels like a “buffoon,” he adds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wilmore has been under fire, in some quarters, for the way in which he wound up his speech at the annual Nerd Prom. The Comedy Central late-night star said that when he was growing up, “a black man was thought by his mere color not good enough to lead a football team — and now, to live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the entire free world, words alone can do me no justice. So, Mr. President, if I’m going to keep it 100: Yo, Barry, you did it, my n*gga. You did it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those blasting Wilmore was WaPo’s editorial board member Jonathan Capehart, who is black. “Sure, there were and are blacks who loved what Wilmore said,” he wrote this morning. “They think that by ‘keeping it 100,’ a latter-day ‘keeping it real,’ Wilmore expressed the undeniable pride African Americans have for Obama, the first lady and everything the first family means and represents to them. But the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was neither Wilmore’s barbershop nor his momma’s house. Obama is president of the United States and should have been accorded the respect that comes with the office — especially by someone who considers himself family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Politico, in posting video of “Larry Wilmore’s Full Remarks at The White House Correspondents’ Dinner” cuts off after “To live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the entire free world, words alone can do me no justice.”\n",

      "Wilmore’s closing line wasn’t the only one that caused the Hinkley Hilton crowd to set up and take notice, though it was by far his most provocative.

      "Donald Trump thinks that a wall can save America. But a stunning new study suggests that his quest to build it could end up making the very issue it's meant to resolve far worse than it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The billionaire showman has proposed a \"big, beautiful wall\" running along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border as a means to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the U.S. By his lights, the wall, which he has estimated would stand anywhere between 30 and 80 feet tall, would help put an end to \"Mexico send[ing] its people\" across the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: New Study Shows Just How Much Undocumented Immigrants Actually Contribute\n",
      "\n",
      "In all reality, if Trump becomes president he won't be able to build his wall — the logistical, fiscal and diplomatic hurtles are insurmountable. It's far more probable he would enhance the tools that already exist to clamp down on the entry of unauthorized migrants — dramatically ramping up border enforcement with more intense patrolling, and building some more fences at frequent entry-points. But his pursuit of such a crackdown could very likely backfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem: As a massive study published in March in the American Journal of Sociology reveals, consistent attempts to make it harder for migrants to enter the U.S. since the 1980s haven't done anything to decrease the undocumented immigration population. Instead, they've actually made the undocumented population far larger. And if there is another spike in undocumented immigration in the future, it could have the same counterproductive effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does cracking down on the border boost the undocumented population? It requires understanding how immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border has worked historically. Mexicans have been crossing the border into the U.S. for higher paying work in great numbers since the mid-20th century, but unlike most migrants crossing an ocean, they usually came temporarily. With a relatively inexpensive path back home and a tendency to take on seasonal work, the majority of Mexican migrants routinely cycled back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "This carried on without issue in the 1940s and 1950s, but in 1965 Congress passed the first-ever limits on immigration from the Western hemisphere. At first immigration from Mexico dipped, but by the late 1970s it had returned to the same rate that existed in the late 1950s. The immigration law changed the legal status of Mexican migrants, but it left the fundamental drivers of migration — labor supply and demand — untouched. And the old connections Mexican workers had with their U.S. employers remained intact despite the law, as well. \"Once opportunities for legal entry constricted, migration did not stop but simply continued under undocumented auspices,\" the study's authors report.\n",

      "Despite the fact that Mexican migration trends stayed roughly the same between the 1950s and the 1970s in terms of volume and destination, a mandate for harsher crackdowns on illegal immigration grew bigger as time went on, and finally picked up serious momentum by the 1980s. Between 1986 and 2008, the U.S. saw a \"fivefold increase in the number of U.S. Border Patrol officers, a fourfold increase in hours spent patrolling the border, and a twenty fold increase in nominal funding.\" But during that same time, the undocumented population quadrupled.\n",

      "Guarding the border more aggressively didn't deter people from coming in, but it did discourage them from leaving. Tweet\n",
      "\n",
      "The study found that the militarization of the border ultimately didn't deter workers desperate for higher wages. Migrants just developed more sophisticated techniques for crossing, increasingly relying on paid specialists, called \"coyotes,\" to make the trip. Even as border security made it tougher to cross without being caught, most migrants who failed would try again until finally making it into the U.S. But once they got into the U.S., the increased cost and difficulty of crossing made it less likely they would return to Mexico; a repeat of the whole ordeal became too expensive and risky. In other words, guarding the border more aggressively didn't deter people from coming into the U.S., but it did discourage them from leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study estimates that the late 20th and early 21st century uptick in enforcement ultimately increased the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. by a third by discouraging their return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The takeaway: The key lesson from the study is that when people are desperate to make a decent living, they'll show extraordinary resolve and ingenuity in finding a way to secure it. Given that migration from Mexico into the U.S. has actually reversed in recent years, immigration hawks needn't worry too much about a growing wave of undocumented immigrants any time soon. But should the flow of migrants pick up again, they should be wary of border crackdowns as a solution.\n",

      "Cop, out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Series co-lead Stana Katic will not be a part of Castle Season 9, the victim of a cast shake-up that reportedly is designed to help cut costs for the aging procedural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources confirm for TVLine that which our sister site Deadline first reported, that Katic, whose one-year extension has expired, was not asked back for the fall (in the event the series gets renewed). Nor will longtime cast member Tamala Jones return as M.E. Lanie Parish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement on the situation, Katic said, “Rather then distract from what was an amazing experience, I would just like to say that I’m very grateful to ABC for giving me the opportunity to be a part of a much beloved show. Thank you to the fans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: The following day, Katic also directed this message at fans:\n",

      "https://twitter.com/Stana_Katic/status/722492283082256385\n",
      "\n",
      "ABC has confirmed both actresses’ exits, and issued this statement: “Kate Beckett has been a beloved character on our hit series Castle for the past eight years. We are grateful for Stana Katic’s talent and dedication to the series and we hope to continue our relationship. Tamala Jones has also been an integral part of the series and we are grateful she was a part of Castle.“\n",
      "\n",
      "How might Beckett be written out? In a new interview with TVLine, co-showrunner Alexi Hawley said that with both Katic’s and Nathan Fillion’s contracts up, the Season 8 finale airing May 16 ends “in a very dynamic way which leaves open the possibility that maybe the show won’t come back in the same form.” In that season ender, titled “Crossfire,” a twist in Rick and Kate’s final pursuit of the high-powered drug lord known as LokSat “puts their case — and their lives —in jeopardy,” seemingly allowing the series the option to kill off the intrepid NYPD police captain.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "A new climate change study seems to suggest that a rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has helped plants propagate around the planet. The findings see contrarians (aka climate change skeptics) reasserting their claim that additional CO2 is beneficial for the planet, since foliage harness these emissions for growth. But the researchers behind the study, Greening of the Earth and its Drivers, insist the extra emissions and subsequent “fertilization effect” are more likely signs of a troubled system struggling to adjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tremendous amount of vegetated land has experienced greening, according to satellite data collected and analyzed by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries. The new greenery is equivalent to more than four billion giant sequoias. If all the extra leaves were laid flat, they’d cover the continental United States – twice! Added CO2 accounts for 70 percent of that growth, with climate change, increased nitrogen, and changes in land management accounting for fractions each. Despite global temperatures reaching a record high last year, only four percent of the world’s vegetated land has experienced depletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to understand how contrarians would consider these findings evidence of the benefits of CO2 emissions. If plant greening were the sole concern, additional CO2 emissions would indeed be advantageous. But CO2 emissions have negative consequences that can ripple through the environment, disrupting the Earth’s feedback mechanisms that keep the system regulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: With climate change in the spotlight, Google makes ‘largest purchase’ of renewable energy\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Philippe Ciais of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences rejects the contrarians’ position as single-minded. “The fallacy of the contrarian argument is two fold,” he told BBC News. “First, the many negative aspects of climate change are not acknowledged. Second, studies have shown that plants acclimatize to rising CO2 concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.” The study’s lead author, Professor Ranga Myneni of Boston University, added that extra greenery would not make up for the other effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and the loss of Arctic sea ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Professor Judith Curry, former chair of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, insists that scientists engage with the arguments of climate change skeptics. Speaking to BBC News, Curry said, against scientific consensus, the contrarians’ position “reflects conflicts of values and a preference for the empirical (i.e. what has been observed) versus the hypothetical (i.e. what is projected from climate models).” This conflict may likewise exist in the general public.\n",

      "A prosecutor in Alabama is calling a nearly 40-year-old man's marriage to his 18-year-old former student a \"sham\" to prevent her from testifying against him in a sex case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew Shane Wester — a 38-year-old former math teacher and one-time coach for both track and football at an Alabama high school — allegedly had sexual contact with one of his students back in 2014. According to AL.com, prosecutors indicted Wester in January 2015, alleging he \"intentionally and knowingly engaged with a male or female student under the age of 19 in sexual contact which was done for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party, to wit - kissing and spending the night with the victim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Wester, who was married with a child at the time of the incident, resigned from his teaching position a month after the indictment, AL.com added. Last June, Wester, who divorced his wife a year ago, married the student, who has been identified as 18-year-old Amy Nicole Cox (Cox has previously shared photos of herself and Wester together, including one now widely-shared picture captioned \"happily married\"). But with the trial against Wester on the horizon at the time of their wedding, authorities are saying the marriage is simply a strategy to stop the teen from testifying against Wester in court — Alabama state law provides married couples with \"marital privilege,\" meaning they can't be forced to testify against each other.\n",

      "Zimbabwe’s national parks put its wildlife up for sale on Tuesday in a bid to save the animals from a devastating drought, Reuters reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zimbabwe’s Parks and Wildlife Management Authority said potential buyers “with the capacity to acquire and manage wildlife” and the requisite land to house the animals should get in touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In light of the drought…Parks and Wildlife Management Authority intends to destock its parks estates through selling some of the wildlife,” the authority said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement did not say what species of animals are up for sale, or whether they would be sold to local or foreign bidders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not have a target. The number of animals depends on the bids we receive,” parks authority spokeswoman Caroline Washaya-Moyo said, according to Reuters. Zimbabwe’s national parks, although already cash-strapped, are known for their herds of elephant, wildebeests, wild buck and big cat predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drought has exacerbated a dire economic situation in the country; Zimbabwe is yet to recover from a failed currency thanks to hyperinflation, international sanctions and corruption allegations. Caused by the effects of the El Nino phenomenon, the lack of water has scorched Zimbabwe’s food and commercial crops leaving 4 million people in need of food aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other parts of southern Africa, conservation parks are providing feed to wild animals that can’t find food due to the drought. Some are also digging or reopening wells for underground water, which can prove to be costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parks authority has sold animals previously to cope with financial pressures. Last year, Zimbabwe exported 20 elephants to China. Those beasts were taken from conservation parks and destined for zoos. International and local animal rights groups’ protests were ignored. Last year, the beloved Cecil the lion was killed by an American dentist in Zimbabwe, causing international outcry.\n"

      "The Bible. It's often cited by conservative politicians and activists in the United States, who are quick to use it as a justification to defend laws limiting the freedom of certain groups of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the case in North Carolina, where Republican Gov. Pat McCrory recently signed the state's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which overturned an anti-discrimination ordinance enacted by the city of Charlotte. It's most controversial element was a reversal of rules that allowed transgender Charlotte residents to use the restroom of their choice. While the governor didn't talk about religion as a pretext, his supporters routinely cite biblical justifications to stand against LGBT Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "With passions inflamed around the country both for and against North Carolina's new law, a good question to ask might be: How many times does the bible mention transgender people and, more specifically, bathroom assignment?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there's certainly no specific mention of transgender people in the bible, the Old Testament seemingly takes a rough line on cross-dressing in the book of Deuteronomy 22:5. \"A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment, for all who do so an abomination to the Lord your God,\" the scripture reads. Though not specifically speaking of transgender individuals, it's hard to infer from this that the Bible would take a very woke position on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bible's tough stance on cross-dressing joins a litany of biblical, often Old Testament justice that is generally out of step with modern times. The Bible, for example, has no issue with slavery, and even comes with helpful tips for slave masters, and endorses polygamy (for men) and murdering your cheating spouse.\n",

      "Muslim citizens are as American as apple pie, a new poll says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey, from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, shows that though Muslims living in America are facing more violence than ever, they are actually among America's most model citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "What exactly does that mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, in a land founded on religious freedom, Muslims are among the most religious and patriotic citizens: 42% of Muslims attend services regularly compared to 45% of Protestants. And 87% of Muslims say religion is important to their lives, compared to 94% of Protestants.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Muslims would continue to show religious pride and attend service is a testament to their faith, especially when 2015 was the worst year for mosque attacks on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to identifying as a patriot, 85% of Muslims \"have a strong American identity,\" just like 84% of Protestants. They are also just as likely as other Americans to identify strongly with their faith — 89% of Muslims, 84% of Jews, and 95% of Catholics and Protestants shared the sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Republican presidential candidates continue to discuss \"radical Islamic terrorism\" in debates, most American Muslims actually reject violence by a much higher margin than other groups. Sixty-five percent of Muslims oppose the targeting and killing of civilians by military groups, much higher than other religious groups. Additionally, the survey found zero correlation between Muslim religious identity, mosque attendance and attitudes toward violence.\n",

      "Muslims make pretty great neighbors, too. Thirty-eight percent of Muslims work with neighbors to solve problems, almost equal to the percentage of Jews (40%) and Catholics (42%) who do so.\n",

      "And while a much lower number of Muslims are registered to vote, among those who are eligible and registered, 85% plan to vote (which is still lower than most groups.)

A combined 27% of non-voting Muslims said that they don't like the proposed candidates or the candidates don't represent them.\n",

Despite facing rampant Islamophobia, 63% of Muslims believe America is on the right track.\n",

      "Trans Girl's Anti-North Carolina Photo Goes Viral For All The Wrong Reasons\n",
      "Transgender activists have routinely pushed back on narratives that they say elevate individuals in their community who might \"pass\" for their preferred gender while marginalizing others whose self-presentation does not conform to the gender binary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to challenge the rigid way society views and classifies people by gender presentation, the thinking goes, we should seek to elevate trans people whose appearance reads neither as stereotypically male nor female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a case in point: On Tuesday, New Jersey-based Meg Bitton Photography agency posted a photo of Corey Maison, who is transgender and appears feminine — so much so that some commenters missed the point of the meme, thinking Maison was cisgender. The company posted the image to speak out North Carolina's HB2, which, among other things, prohibits municipalities in the state from adopting protections for trans folks who wish to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If this was YOUR daughter, would you be comfortable sending her into a men's bathroom?\" the photo's caption reads. \"'Neither would I. Be fair. Be kind. Be empathetic. Treat others how you would like to be treated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the meme is well-intentioned, it subtly reinforces the same prejudice it seeks to challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "For one thing, gender nonconformity isn't always as neatly presentable as Maison's photo suggests. By making Maison a poster child for the gender bathroom issue, the photo implies that society should be uncomfortable with people in bathrooms who don't read as men or women. But transgender individuals who don't \"pass\" are just as deserving of protection and media attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another variant of the pro-trans meme evinces the problem even more obviously. Take the photograph below of a transgender performer Kelly Lauren. Accompanying the image, in which Lauren presents herself as feminine, she asks: \"Houston, do you REALLY want me in the same restroom as your husband or boyfriend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We get the point, and Lauren is no doubt being cheeky. But encouraging opponents of LGBT rights to oppose bathroom bills because they feel uncomfortable with people of other genders using their restrooms misses the point. You don't fight prejudice with prejudice. It's akin to saying anti-gay lawmakers are gay themselves, reinforcing the idea that there's something wrong with being LGBT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of trans rights have posted images on social media depicting gender-nonconforming men or women as a scare tactic, which underscores the point: We should be as comfortable with people who look like the person in the photo below as we are, or should be, with Maison.\n",
      "\n",
      "A photo posted by (@) on\n",
      "\n",
      "Presenting people who appear gender nonconforming may stoke people's prejudices in the short term, but we should do it anyway. Eventually, the culture will learn to accept the diversity of the trans experience. A large part of the reason the LGBT movement has made so many inroads on gay rights is by pushing gay people and relationships into the spotlight. This may have made some opponents of LGBT rights think \"ick\" at first, but over time it served to humanize them and change public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"ick factor\" is what has led to a slate of anti-LGBT legislation. According to the Human Rights Campaign, there are nearly 200 proposed measures in 33 states so far this year that seek to restrict the rights and liberties of LGBT individuals, under the guise of so-called religious freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maison should not be forced into a bathroom where she in uncomfortable, and there is nothing wrong with her self-presentation. But the debate about who is impacted by anti-LGBT laws must remain inclusive to maximize impact from the advocacy.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, Target (tgt) announced that it would allow transgender people to use bathrooms and dressing rooms that correspond to their own gender identity, taking a stand in the restroom controversy that has created uproar in states like North Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backlash against the retailer from traditionalists started immediately. On Wednesday, the American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, started a petition urging people to boycott Target until it changed its policy, which the group claimed “endangers women and children by allowing men to frequent women’s facilities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By Friday afternoon, more than 190,000 people had signed the AFA’s pledge. Others were angrily posting on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #BoycottTarget.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the case of Target, supporters of the retailer and its bathroom policy began tweeting using the same #BoycottTarget hashtag to accuse others of bigotry. One Twitter user also illustrated the practical complications of requiring transgender people to use the bathroom matching their sex at birth:\n",

      "Target replied to at least one customer who complained on Facebook that the restroom policy would compromise shoppers’ safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We also offer a single-stall, wheelchair accessible, bathroom for guests who need more space or who are more comfortable with that format,” a Target employee named Andy replied to the customer from the retailer’s Facebook account.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement to Fortune, a Target spokesperson acknowledged the controversy but said the retailer planned to stick with its new bathroom policy: “We certainly respect that there are a wide variety of perspectives and opinions,” the spokesperson said. “As a company that firmly stands behind what it means to offer our team an inclusive place to work—and our guests an inclusive place to shop—we continue to believe that this is the right thing for Target.”\n",

      "In March, North Carolina's legislature passed a controversial new law reversing the effects of a Charlotte ordinance that had previously protected the rights of individuals who identify as LGBT. Among other things, the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (better known as House Bill 2 or H.B. 2) made it illegal for transgender people to use public bathrooms that do not match the sex listed on their birth certificates, sparking national outrage and causing multiple corporations to boycott the state.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a recent essay for Mother Jones, Charlie Comero — a 35-year-old trans man who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina — explained how this law has affected him personally, and in the process, perfectly nailed why H.B. 2 makes it dangerous for trans individuals to use a public restroom in North Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where do I go to the bathroom now? It's literally against the law for me to use the men's room, and it's also risky,\" Comero writes. \"Even though I'm more than a year on testosterone — I'm getting facial hair, my hair has receded a little — I still don't always pass as male. Or do I use the women's room, follow the law, and clearly make people uncomfortable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The brilliant but heartbreaking way Comero has chosen to deal with the problem is by passing out cards that explain what he's doing in the women's bathroom. In fact, the idea went viral late last month — but, as he explains, the cards don't always work, because people don't always accept them.\n",

      "\n",
      "To be honest, Idol haters have been expecting this news for years now — since Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul left the show during Season 9; or when the lovable-but-unmarketable Taylor Hicks won Season 5; or maybe even after Carrie Underwood, who triumphed ELEVEN years ago, became the last winner to rack up multiplatinum album sales.\n",

      "But I never gave up on this show. And I am so glad I didn’t, because over the past 15 seasons, many contestants, even ones who didn’t exactly set the charts on fire post-Idol, have delivered some truly fantastic performances. And I got to witness — and write about — all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While nearly a decade and a half of Idol has yielded countless cringeworthy karaoke performances that had Simon Cowell making cat-in-a-blender analogies and Randy Jackson using the word “pitchy” more times than he said “in it to win it,” there were many watercooler-chatter-worthy breakout moments that lent the show much-needed credibility. Idol was always supposed to be a talent show, and it indeed leaves behind a legacy of great talent.\n",

But I enthusiastically encourage you to hit up YouTube or Hulu and binge-watch anything and everything by Adam Lambert, Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, Allison Iraheta, Fantasia, et al, and well as this season’s Trent Harmon, La'Porsha Renae, and Dalton Rapattoni.

AMAZING. I still secretly suspect that Heejun was planning to do this all along, and that his time on Idol leading up to this breakthrough had been one long genius act of performance art.

Then, in a week when the contestants could pick any (cleared) song of the 2000s, Taylor went with Ray LaMontagne’s “Trouble” – which was not very well-known at that time – declaring it one of his favorite songs. This display of taste and artistry put him in an entirely new light for me. Years later, I will say: Yes, Taylor, you do make me proud.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alex, my personal favorite contestant of Idol Season 13, had many great moments that year, but Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind” allowed him to showcase what he always did best: “a sensitive interpretation with a beautiful tone,” as Harry Connick Jr. put it. This gave me some J.Lo-style goosies — especially when Alex broke out that falsetto at the end. He changed up the song just enough to make it his own, while staying respectful to the classic original. Alex is still on my mind.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sure, this was cheesier than a CostCo-sized box of Cheetos, but it was basically Constantine’s sex-eyed audition for Broadway’s Rock of Ages. And he later received a very deserved Tony nomination for that!\n",

      "34. Colton Dixon – “Piano Man” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy Joel Night was a mostly dreary affair, but Season 11’s resident piano man closed the show in style, going back to his roots after a few weeks of mostly just using his piano as a prop to jump upon. (He also stayed true to his literal roots, refusing to heed short-term in-house “style expert” Tommy Hilfiger’s lame advice to change his trademark skunky hairstyle.) This performance was simply magnificent. I still haven’t quite gotten over Colton’s shocking seventh-place elimination. I’d always hoped Colton and his awesome hair would make it to the very end.\n",

      "\n",
      "After connecting in rehearsal with Sia as they talked about living with bi-polar disorder, during this season’s top four week, this former boy band singer seemed energized and inspired – and he gave a thrillingly unhinged, refreshingly raw performance of Sia “Bird Set Free.” When he belted, “And I don’t care if I sing off-key/I find myself in my melodies/I sing for love, I sing for me,” he really meant it, man. He was totally connected, totally in the moment, giving it his all, and by the end, he was spent and sobbing. And so was everyone else.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chikezie only made it to 10th place, and the next time he was in the news, it was because he was busted on felony theft charges. But he had one moment of glory, and it was this amazing, chicken-fried, O Brother-style revamp of a Beatles classic. (A highlight of a mostly disastrous Lennon & McCartney Night featuring Kristy Lee Cook’s scarring-for-life “Eight Days a Week” debacle.) O Chikezie, where art thou now? This performance totally holds up, seven years later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Carrie may be one of the most successful Idols, but she’s low on this list because back in Season 4, the young and green singer exhibited very little charisma. (She herself has admitted to this.) However, this dynamic Heart cover was the first sign that she had the potential to be America’s next superstar.\n",

      "30. Skylar Laine – “Stay With Me” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Skylar came stomping out of the gate right at the start of the season, with a top 25 week performance that was nothing short of a raucous revelation. From the ballsy Faces song choice, to the sassy delivery, to the fun table-turning of Rod Stewart’s original misogynist lyrics… there was a lot to enjoy about Skylar’s vivacious performance. It was just the cowgirl-boot-kick up the bum that this show needed.\n",

      "29. Quentin Alexander – “I Put a Spell On You” (Season 14)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was ready to vote for this superfly guy the instant he strutted out wearing parachute pantaloons, stacks of tribal jewelry, a chubby fun-fur rave coat, and the fiercest, most fearless sex-eyed camera-stare since, well, Constantine’s. And then Quentin did a crazysexycool version of “I Put a Spell on You.” This was theater. This was a performance. And it put a spell on me, for sure. OK, so maybe this wasn’t quite at the level of Annie Lennox’s phenomenal rendition of the Screamin’ Jay Hawkins classic at the Grammys. But it was pretty freakin’ awesome. (And George Clinton agreed! Why wasn’t George ever a mentor on this show?)\n",

      "\n",
      "Somehow J.Hud ended up in the bottom three (with Fantasia and LaToya London, on one of the most controversial elimination nights ever) a couple weeks after performing this tour de force. But this powerful performance was just a sign of the greatness to come in her career.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. Paul McDonald – “Maggie May” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "More of a Paste magazine coverboy than a typical pop star, Paul brought alt-country (and a really awesome Nudie suit) to the national stage. His risky cover of Ryan Adams’s “Come Pick Me Up” was another Season 11 standout, but his unique rasp suited this Rod Stewart classic perfectly, so this has to be my Paul pick.\n",

      "26. Joey Cook – “Mad World” (Season 14)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joey did the Donnie Darko version of “Mad World,” and while it wasn’t quite at the same level as Adam Lambert’s rendition from Season 8, it actually came really close. Eschewing her usual goofiness — no accordion, no ukulele, no wacky dancing or Postmodern Jukebox hyperstylization — Joey gave a simple and stripped performance, totally connected to the audience and the song. And she thrilled without even getting up out of her chair. I really enjoyed seeing this once-gimmicky girl blossom into such a fascinating and multi-faceted performer over the course of her season. Joey Cook is the real deal.\n",

      "\n",
      "Who would have thought the Aussie alt-rocker would have such a wow moment on Dolly Parton Night? This performance is a bittersweet reminder of what might have been. The talented crooner was shockingly eliminated in eighth place, and he even more shockingly died suddenly in 2014, at age 35.\n",

      "\n",
      "I’m only just now beginning to realize what a great year Season 11 was, seeing that so many performances on this list came from that cycle. It was arguably the last truly great Idol season, and this was another highlight. Elise took a HUGE risk by covering Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” (“the hardest song in the world to sing,” according to Randy Jackson), but she rose to the occasion. “I wasn’t sure if you could pull that off, because nobody can pull that song off,” began Steven Tyler (who apparently didn’t watch Idol Season 8, when Adam Lambert murdered this tune), “but you made Robert Plant proud tonight!” I’ve still got a whole lotta love for this rad rock goddess.\n",

      "23. Brooke White – “Love Is a Battlefield” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "David Cook and Chikezie weren’t the only contestants changing things up in the Season 7, the first Idol season on which contestants were allowed to play instruments. The season featured a slew of creative and adventurous musicians the likes of which the show had never seen, and the Carole King-like Brooke was one of the best. Her reimagining of Pat Benatar’s early-MTV pop-rock anthem as a bittersweet folk ballad was inspired.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. La'Porsha Renae - “No More Drama” (Season 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "This final season was such an emotional one. Along with Dalton’s “Bird Set Free” and guest performer Kelly Clarkson’s tearkerking “Piece by Piece,” La'Porsha had a major moment (in a season filled with great moments) when she sang this Mary J. Blige empowerment anthem. As a domestic abuse survivor, she clearly connected with the song, and she poured all of her pain and sorrow into her triumphant performance. Despite the song’s title, this was incredibly dramatic. And it was magical.\n",

      "21. Lilly Scott – “Fixing a Hole” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything went wrong for Season 9 on the night that Lilly (along with Todrick Hall, Katelyn Epperly, and Alex Lambert) went home, right before making the top 12. Watch this delightful ukulele romp (a definite precursor to Season 14’s Joey Cook) and imagine what might have been if Lilly had gone farther.\n",

      "20. Allison Iraheta – “Cry Baby” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "A rocker chick has, sadly, never won American Idol. But this flame-haired badass gave the boys a run for their rock ‘n’ roll money in Season 8 and made it to the top four during the most male-dominated Idol season ever. I was crying like a baby when she was voted off the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. James Durbin – “You Got Another Thing Comin’” (Season 10)\n",
      "\n",
      "The headbanger begged America to “give metal a chance,” and viewers listened, voting James through to the top four. This was the first, and last, time that a Judas Priest song got covered on Idol (aside from the Season 10 finale, when James jammed with Judas themselves). Crank this up to 11 and enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Phillip Phillips – “Volcano” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "P-Squared had had a couple of really rough weeks prior to making the top four, but with this gorgeous cover of a gem by Irish singer-songwriter Damien Rice, he totally redeemed himself. It may have been a risk for him to do such a relatively obscure tune at such a crucial point in the season, and I was bracing myself to hear Jennifer Lopez slam him for being too “artsy” (as she had when Phillip performed the Dave Matthews Band’s “The Stone” during the top six week). But even J.Lo had to admit that this was “one of the most beautiful, poignant moments a contestant has ever had.” Eschewing his usual jam-band shtick and fratty DMB copycattiness, and playing on a hushed, darkened stage with just a cellist and a female backup singer (who was no slouch herself), Phillip generated some real magic here.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Norman Gentle – “And I Am Telling You” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this is another joke contestant, a la Heejun Han. And yes, I did actually rank Norman higher than an Oscar-winner who is famous for what most people would argue is a much better version of this Dreamgirls anthem. So I must be insane, right? Maybe, but I say Norman was the funniest and most fearless Idol contestant ever, and the fact that he actually made it to the live semifinals is pretty remarkable. Norman gave THE best exit performance ever. He will never be forgotten. And he better be invited to the Season 15 finale this year!\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Siobhan Magnus – “Paint It Black” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Siobhan, one of the quirkiest quirky girls that ever quirked on Idol, served up riot grrl realness on Rolling Stones Night, with this dark and stormy performance. Imagine Courtney Love with Ann Wilson pipes, and you’ll get an idea of how fantastic this was.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Trent Harmon - “Chandelier” (Season 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think everyone thought La'Porsha Renae had a lock on the competition this year – until Trent showed up in top four week and did this. It’s not like Trent was ever an underdog to begin with, but this was his script-flipping, Kris Allen-does-“Heartless” sort of moment. It was seismic. And I think the other three must have known they were in danger after they saw him sing. Because this was the look on their faces as they golf-clapped for his performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Jena Irene – “Can’t Help Falling in Love” (Season 13)\n",
      "\n",
      "I adored this performance, and not because it made J.Lo cry (and drop an F-bomb on live television, thus resulting in some very glitchy last-minute editing). Jena’s refreshingly cool and modern, Regina Spektorian interpretation of the 1961 Elvis Presley classic was gorgeous, and — to borrow a more G-rated word from J.Lo’s vocabulary — simply “goosies”-inducing. How did Jena, who placed second that season, not get a major-label record deal of her own? That’s a real reason to curse… or cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Caleb Johnson – “Dazed and Confused” (Season 13)\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh hell yes. Season 13’s Idol top nine show, future champion Caleb made rock history as only the fourth contestant granted permission to cover Led Zeppelin (following Season 8’s Adam Lambert, Season 10’s Haley Reinhart, and Season 11’s Elise Testone — so Caleb was in great company, there). He belted the Zep version of “Dazed and Confused,” and I was left amazed and enthused. This was rad! This felt authentic and awesome… and even “sexy,” as a hot-and-bothered J.Lo attested. Unfortunately, nothing on Caleb’s rushed-then-quickly-forgotten debut album rocked nearly as hard as this, aside from maybe his Justin Hawkins-penned coronation song. But Caleb is still responsible for one of the most headbanging Idol moments ever, and that totally rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Casey Abrams & Haley Reinhart – “Moanin’” (Season 10)\n",
      "\n",
      "Casey and Haley both had their great solo moments on the show, but here they have the honor of being the only duet to make this list. Casey and Haley likely instilled an appreciation for jazz in a whole new generation of young viewers with this sultry, electric performance of this Bobby Timmons 1950s standard. Nowadays, the two continue to make beautiful music together as part of the jazzy collective Postmodern Jukebox.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Jason Castro - “Hallelujah” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Many singing-show contestants have covered this Leonard Cohen classic (it was MacKenzie Bourg’s swan song last week), but Jason’s remains the definitive Idol version; the song really should have been retired from reality television after he did it. His performance was in fact so popular that iTunes downloads of the Cohen, Jeff Buckley, and Rufus Wainwright versions skyrocketed the day after this aired.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Casey James - “Jealous Guy” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "True “wow moments” were sadly few and far between on Season 9, what was arguably the most disappointing season in Idol history (at least until Season 12 came along). But on Lennon & McCartney Night, eventual third-place contestant Casey’s emotional rendition of John Lennon’s dark and desperate “Jealous Guy” was unexpectedly magical. His voice, possibly due to an authentic lump in his throat, took on a gruff, Eddie Vedder-esque quality during his raw performance, and he seemed genuinely choked up. And so were viewers, by the song’s end.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Bo Bice – “Whipping Post” (Season 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to believe there was ever a time when viewers actually thought runner-up Bo had a chance of winning over future superstar Carrie Underwood, but watch the performance below and it’ll all make sense. Season 4 was the first season when the age limit on Idol was raised (from 25 to 28), and Bo made it clear that the big boys had come to play. His hair-whipping Allman Brothers cover (Willow Smith ain’t got nothin’ on Bo) was all grown-up, with the first hint of actual macho rock ‘n’ roll danger ever seen on this squeaky-clean show. Bo even managed to steal the thunder of his fellow Season 4 rocker Constantine Maroulis with this gritty, Southern rock tour de force.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Candice Glover – “Lovesong” (Season 12)\n",
      "\n",
      "Things were looking pretty dire in Idol’s troubled 12th season, with all of the hype centered on that stupid Mariah Carey/Nicki Minaj feud. But when future champion Candice covered the Cure, all was right with Idol once more. Viewers remembered just how magical this show could really be. Candice’s exquisite performance, which owed more to Adele’s jazzy cover version than to the Cure’s gloomy 1989 original, even had Mariah paying the ultimate compliment: randomly sprinkling Candice with celebratory glitter. “On the behalf of my fellow judges, let me say that was one of the greatest performances in the history of Idol, in all 12 years!” Randy Jackson added. Candice should really be a bigger star today.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Joshua Ledet – “It’s A Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joshua received more standing ovations than any other contestant in the history of American Idol. And deservedly so. Mantasia’s “When a Man Loves a Woman” was almost as brilliant as “Man’s World,” but this was a particularly outrageous performance, full of fire and ferocity and sweat and swagger, and he sang like one of the old-time greats. By the end, J.Lo wasn’t just on her feet, she was almost on her knees, bowing down to him. Steven Tyler was equally worshipful, raving, “No man or woman has ever sang that good with that much passion, ever. I can go home right now. I’ve never heard anything like that in my life!” Randy even called this “one of the best performances in the history of any singing show.” The fact that Joshua didn’t make the finale that year is one of Idol’s great tragedies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Kris Allen – “Heartless” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was perhaps the most game-changing performance in Idol history. Going into Season 8’s top three week, most people would have bet it was Danny Gokey who’d take a place in the following week’s finale alongside Adam Lambert. But after Kris’s acoustic-folk rendition of Kanye West’s “Heartless,” all bets were off. Suddenly, Kris was the man to beat. He made it to the finale over Danny after this, in what was a perfect example of an underdog Idol contestant peaking at just the right time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Kelly Clarkson – “Natural Woman” (Season 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "When Idol first launched, Kelly was far from the frontrunner. It was all about Tamyra Gray and Justin Guarini, and in fact, Kelly’s first audition didn’t even air! But then Kelly came out in her suit and tie and delivered this sultry, star-making performance with THAT NOTE. She’s been Idol’s number-one girl ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. David Cook – “Hello” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Cook came along, Idol was considered a glorified karaoke competition. Sure, many of the singers delivered fabulous vocals, but they rarely did anything new with their songs. And then there was David. He pretty much changed everything, proving there was a real art to cover songs, an art that went way beyond just singing the words as capably as the original artists had. Idol has been “Cookified” ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fantasia – “Summertime” (Season 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just pure magic. All of America held its breath as Ms. Barrino stunned with this nuanced, sophisticated rendition of this Porgy & Bess classic. Fantasia has been in the news in recent years more for her turbulent personal life, but watch her landmark performance below and get a welcome reminder than she is one of the greatest singers to ever grace the Idol stage. Even guest judge Quentin Tarantino was impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Blake Lewis – “You Give Love a Bad Name” (Season 6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before David Cook, beatboxing boy wonder Blake was the first contestant to do a cover on Idol that really turned a song up on its end and changed it entirely. His Bon Jovi cover is the stuff of legend, and if curmudgeonly Jon Bon Jovi seemed to hate it, that’s probably because he was just jealous that his own version was not nearly as awesome. Blake’s performance was just the shot through the heart, and in the arm, that this show needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Adam Lambert – “Ring of Fire” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was probably the most polarizing performance on Idol, and definitely the most exciting. Love him or hate him, Adam knew how to get people’s attention, sometimes get people downright angry, and make those who were faint of heart and/or feeble of mind squirm in their support hose — all very good things in the world of rock and pop. On this fateful night, Adam took a strong stance, making it clear that he planned to stay true to himself, even if that meant freaking out Randy Travis with his Goth manicure or refusing to “go country” on Opry Night (though I think black-clad country maverick Johnny Cash would have appreciated this remake). Many Glambert performances — “Mad World,” “Tracks of My Tears,” “Whole Lotta Love” — could’ve made this list, but “Ring of Fire” is the one that really put Adam on the glittery map.\n",

      "It's an unfortunate truth of the internet that no matter what you say, somebody, somewhere will get upset about it. The persistence of that truth seems to increase roughly 1,000 percent when you say something about Harley-Davidson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't matter what you say –– it can be good, it can be bad, it can be indifferent. You could make a seemingly innocuous statement like, \"Harley-Davidson is a company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that is best known for selling motorcycles,\" and someone will lose their mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OMGWTFBBQ! THIS GUY IS SUCH AN IDIOT,\" an anonymous commenter will opine. \"HE'S OBVIOUSLY BEING PAID BY THE COMPETITION. HE'S PROBABLY NEVER RIDDEN. RIDEAPART HAS REALLY GONE DOWNHILL SINCE LEFT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really like that this is a truth of the internet, but it is. So, when a few people took issue with some of the things I wrote in a recent review of the Harley-Davidson Street Glide Special, I didn't really pay much attention. Haters gonna hate, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "READ MORE: Riding On the Wrong Side: Living the Dream | RideApart\n",
      "\n",
      "But then RideApart's creative director, Jim Downs, brought it up with me in an email conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Playing devil's advocate, I have to ask,\" he wrote. \"What's your beef with them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a question that knocked me back a little, because the short answer to his question is: none. I have no beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I first found RideApart many years ago while in the process of searching for articles about the Iron 883, a bike that I loved the look of so much it made me want to return to motorcycling after a few years break.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I eventually rode one, I was considerably less enthusiastic about the bike, but I still get all dreamy eyed every time I see one on the road. I'm like that for most Harley-Davidson motorcycles; I really like the looks of them. As I wrote of the Street Glide Special: \"It looks fantastic. This is a motorcycle upon which any sane human being wants to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In that same review, I also wrote: \"Riding a Harley is like riding a tractor. riding a tractor is awesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which, to me, isn't an attack — unless the definition of \"awesome\" has changed since I left the United States 10 years ago. I did have some criticisms of the bike, but that's part of a review: You look for things that might become issues to the people who eventually shell out thousands of dollars/pounds/euros/darseks for a bike.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, for the sake of answering Jim fully, I decided to sit back and ask myself, honestly: Am I, in some way, biased against Harley-Davidson?\n",

      "READ MORE: 2016 Yamaha FJR1300A & FJR1300ES Sport Touring Models — Ride Review | RideApart\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's impossible to write about motorcycles without some kind of bias. Otherwise every article would just be a list of numbers. The trick to writing honestly, I think, is adjusting your bias to favor the motorcycle-in-question's stated strengths. So, for example, no one ever complains that a BMW S1000RR isn't suitable for off-road trails, or that a Honda Goldwing can't do the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. We don't expect those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the real question is not whether I'm biased, but whether I'm failing to adequately adjust my bias when assessing a Harley-Davidson. Am I expecting things that shouldn't be expected?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I don't know. To me, if you sell a motorcycle for more than US $23,000 and you tell people that it is \"plush, top-end touring technology,\" that's kind of what I expect. My experience was that the bike in question didn't meet those expectations. It was uncomfortable and not up to the given task of touring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even there I didn't feel I was being excessively harsh. I went so far as to point out that my experience might be unique (my 6-foot-1 frame is apparently beyond the target audience of Harley ergonomics) and suggest that if a rider's expectations were different than my own — if he or she planned to use the bike less for touring and more for stylin' and profilin' — it might still be worth the asking price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel my expectations were fair. Or, would have been fair if I had been riding any other bike...\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's not any other bike, is it? A Harley-Davidson is a wholly unique thing, and perhaps to assess it you have to do so in a wholly unique way. Maybe part of the unique way is to be consumed of the same mindset that makes so many of its customers so vociferously loyal. You have to be able to place yourself under the Harley spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I was uncomfortable, because the bike hurt my lower back and gave me a headache, I wasn't really able to do that. I wasn't able to connect on a metaphysical level, and as a result, was left to evaluate the bike as just a material thing.\n",
      "\n",

      "It's drawn heavy criticism from celebrities, corporations and activist organizations, and since Springsteen's announcement Friday, scores of musicians have been coming forward with their own acts of protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly every artist that's protested the bill has a different strategy on how to disrupt the state's norms. Some have cancelled tour dates; others have scheduled special concerts to increase visibility for the very groups the bill puts at risk. One should not underestimate the power of a musician's boycott: Such boycotts during the South African anti-apartheid movement and the Jim Crowe South highlighted the injustices taking places in both places and helped shift public opinion.\n",

      "\n",
      "Statement: \"In the 1970s, I, along with many other writers and artists, participated in a similar action against apartheid in South Africa, and, as you know, this eventually proved to be very effective.

      "Florida native Mason Perkins sometimes feels a little unsafe using public mens restrooms — \"I usually go into the male one but I have to kind of hide my face,\" he said — so when he was in a Florida Target last week, he jumped at the opportunity to use a restroom that had been specifically designated as trans-inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was in the Target bathroom, Perkins snapped a selfie and uploaded it to Facebook with the pointed caption \"SHOUT OUT TO TARGET for letting me get up close and personal with their toilets, really enjoyed it, raped a total of zero children while pissing it was great 10/10 would piss again.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Target announced in a statement in April that it officially supported customers using whichever bathroom matches their gender identity.

      "\"It's just absolutely ridiculous,\" Perkins said of the anti-trans hysteria surround the bathroom debate. \"They're trying to accuse me of doing something I haven't even done just so I can't share a space with them ... You know it's just their own personal bigotry.\" And, Perkins pointed out, \"They should know that that've probably used a bathroom with a trans person\" without even realizing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Perkins said Target's new policy, and other signs of institutions moving toward trans-inclusivity, make him \"definitely, definitely hopeful\" for the future.

They had to move them to that dorm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But besides the campus-wide letters they've received urging them to wash their hands frequently, throw away snotty tissues and stop sharing drinking and eating utensils, students say the scare in the air has ebbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When it first started, there were fewer than 10 cases and people were very afraid of it,\" said Consuelo Hylton, a 20-year-old student who knows someone currently quarantined, in a phone interview. (Hylton's sister Antonia also works at Mic.) \"Right after spring break, most students had given up and stopped thinking about it. At this point, it's kind of a joke. Most people say we're all gonna get mumps and then go off on summer break and spread it. But it's not really funny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dumbfounding thing here is that mumps is an old disease. It's broken out at Harvard before — in 1937. Most children are vaccinated against it. But according to Anita Barry, director of the Infectious Disease Bureau of the Boston Public Health Commission, the mumps vaccine only works 88% of the time. That's a B+ at best, depending on the curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's most alarming now isn't how those first two students, an undergraduate and a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School, originally got mumps. In the face of a rare outbreak months before students go back to their home states, countries and continents, the number of cases is only rising.\n",

      "This Dad's Epic Takedown of Anti-Trans Bathroom Laws Is Going Viral\n",
      "Dad jokes may be groan-inducing, but it turns out dad takedowns are worthy of a standing ovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Dallas resident, and father of a 21-year-old daughter, posted a Facebook status on April 14 that, in the short time it's been on the social networking site, has garnered over 5,000 shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the post, Steven Rudner, who is the chair of Equality Texas' board of directors, spoke out against the recent wave of anti-transgender laws in the United States, most notably HB2 in North Carolina, which forces people to use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth, not their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the post, Rudner speaks candidly about the things that worry him when it comes to raising a daughter — one of which is not whether she uses the bathroom with transgender women.\n",
      "\n",
      "I worry about her being sexually assaulted, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of a drunk driver, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of gun violence, because lots of people die from gun-related injuries. Here's what I do not worry about: I don't worry about her being attacked in a restroom by a trans woman because (a) it has never happened; and (b) trans women are the most victimized group of people I've ever met, and the least likely to commit a crime of indecency in a restroom, because they are afraid of getting beat up when all they want to do is pee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner's post directly confronts the transgender bathroom predator myth, often the fuel behind anti-trans legislation. These myths persist despite zero recorded instances of a transgender person ever assaulting someone in a restroom. Conversely, many transgender and gender nonconforming people feel nervous using a restroom that does not match their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several individuals and businesses have spoken out against the laws since they were passed. Corporate giants like PayPal have moved business out of North Carolina, retailer Target has publicly stated that anyone can use the bathroom or fitting room of their choice and even a local Georgia Kroger put up a sign explaining why they have unisex bathrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commenters seem to love Rudner's logic and empathy. The post has been universally praised, including by openly gay Pennsylvania state representative Brian Sims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner ends his post by pointing out the need for kindness and acceptance toward trans people.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here is something else I don't worry about: I don't worry about my daughter being cruel and inhumane to trans men, women or kids, because my wife and I have raised her to have values and because she is a kind person. There are things to worry about. And then there are things people want you to worry about to conceal their agenda of discrimination and hate. Wake up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sort of kindness Rudner describes is sorely needed: In the wake of HB2's passage, calls to one trans-focused crisis hotline have nearly doubled.\n"

      "Newly released video shows precisely what happened during a 2013 incident in which Chicago police officers claimed a local reverend hit them with a car, eventually charging her with attempted murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video, courtesy of CBS Chicago, paints a much different picture of what happened to Rev. Catherine Brown, who is black, after her run-in with Officers Jose López and Michelle Morsi-Murphy on May 13, 2013. The clip reveals it was the officers' vehicle that caused the collision. Officers involved can clearly be seen laughing, hitting her car with a metal rod, drawing and pointing firearms, hitting her and using pepper spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to CBS Chicago, Brown said the beating was the result of a traffic dispute after the officers drove down an alleyway heading to her driveway. In her account, the officers immediately escalated what should have been an innocuous traffic maneuver into a full-on screaming match involving firearms and profanity. Brown attempted to drive away, but the driver of the Chicago police vehicle rammed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beat me down to my underwear, pulled my skirt off me,\" Brown told the station. \"They beat me with the sticks and hit me with their boots in my head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverend was eventually charged with attempted murder after Morsi-Murphy said Brown's car had dragged her down the street, causing the officer to be hospitalized. The charges were later dropped, although Brown was convicted of a misdemeanor charge, reckless conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "ABC 7 reported Brown is suing the department.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, the Department of Justice began a major investigation of the Chicago Police Department over extensive allegations of excessive force and other misconduct. The probe seeks to discover whether the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Chicago resident Laquan McDonald, which resulted in protests and a $5 million settlement, is tied to \"racial, ethnic or other disparities in officers' use of force, and its systems of accountability,\" NBC 5 reported.\n",

      "I cannot recall the minutiae of the day that we met because it doesn't matter. I know that I was in my auntie's living room, the one with the good furniture and new couches, carpet the color and texture of sand underneath us. I cannot be sure of my age, but I know that I was not yet seven, because on the day that I did turn seven, I floated along elated, buoyant with the knowledge that I had lived the same number of years as the title of my favorite song. I have no memory of the weather, just the even, controlled temperature of the apartment and the long sliver of sunlight filtering through the blinds and stretching a rectangle across the floor, a spotlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "My auntie unwraps a package delivered via USPS, slicing through cardboard and paper until her hands produce her prize: a pair of VHS tapes. He gleams at me, gorgeous and lambent under the thin film of plastic. I run my hands over his shiny prettiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" I ask. \"Prince.\" She replies. She rips away the protective covering and pops the tape into the VCR. Prince and his guitar stretch the bounds of the TV's volume, the carpet serving as my transmitter, each fiber soaking up the electronic funk, the melancholy, the black jubilance of Purple Rain, the artist’s semiautobiographical film, delivering it to my cells and self via my soles. By the time we make it to the first cassette of The Hits Vol. 1, the floor is aflame, my body and being along with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Prince came to me that day, his voice fluctuating from coquettish falsetto to sorrowful bass and every variance in between, all my concepts of black maleness and masculinity imploded. I did not need him to be male or female because it was inconsequential; his gender was the same as God's. But I knew that he was black immediately. Who but a black genius could flip his hair, shoulder length and straightened, with eyes glimmering and wide, resplendent with the knowledge of his own audacity?\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Chicagoan, my first concepts of Midwestern identity were based on what we are not: we are neither the East Coast, nor the West. We are amorphous, undefined in a great many ways. I had always understood that the weirdos, the artists and fairies and savants, were products of America's cool coasts; perhaps proximity to sea water is required to fertilize genius. And then there was Prince, a black femme from nowhere adorning his body in purple, deigning himself royalty and not even entertaining contemplations of the contrary. The nerve of him, my god; to be black and boy and born in the Midwest, sprouted from America's heartland, and be a freak. To hold onto his softness, his femaleness, in a world that would have it stamped out. This is not a world that is kind to us, women and womanly folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a ‘90s baby, pop culture was fed to me along with milk and cereal, meaning that I have always been enveloped in misogyny, both implicit and overt, that left me raw and reeling as a girl. I grew resentful of my black girl-ness, my femininity. I quickly came to understand that femininity and feminine people are only valued as things to be consumed, for use and sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite rap songs were the raunchiest, nastiest ones. Songs I was forced to sneak into my grandmother's house, possessing the astuteness to print their lyrics off of my school computer but not the guile to avoid internalizing their fumes, to avoid them seeping into my girl bones and rotting me from the inside out. We lived in the projects, an environment of forced intimacy and communal culture, and songs that I did not discover on my own still reached me via the open windows and doors of my neighbors. Just like the music, ugliness and chaos always found me, like secondhand smoke, via my neighbors and comrades. Boys from my building would gather in the court ways for dogfights that I could never force myself to watch. But I would walk to school in the morning and pass the walkways purpled with blood, with clumps of fur and cartilage spotting the landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until I came to know Prince that I was able to divorce these sounds and images of violence and carnage from my presumed ideas of masculinity. He was my introduction to nontoxic masculinity. He was a male form, but he was not destructive. He was sexual, but he was not predatory. Holy, but not chaste. He did want to do filthy things with you, but he wanted to love you as well, and of course you would love him in return. Of course. Prince was the inauguration of this idea for me, black boys as tenderthings, things I could touch and maybe love without piercing the skin of my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea how I would have come to reconcile my own queerness if Prince had not done it first. I wanted to be both the man and the lover he crooned for. I wanted to possess the hair atop his glorious head and to run my fingers through it as well. I saw that image of Wendy and Lisa, their hands intertwined along the black and white of a keyboard telling us of their dreams, and wanted to add my own, a third set of digits atop theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't feel the need to fully work out whether he was a girl or a boy, because when those first holy notes of \"I Would Die 4 U\" blasted through my aunt's speakers, he assured me that he was neither, but as mighty as both. The pitch of that tambourine, the cadence of his voice, cool, level, and our champion, black and bathed in purple light and lace. What was he if not a black femme in church, delivering the sermon and receiving it as well, his body writhing and contorting as he was filled with a holy spirit which very well may have been his own?\n",
      "\n",
      "I watched him, felt him, heard him, drank him in and knew that this celestial being, a supernova housed in a black boy vessel, had no use for mortal constraints as silly and diminutive as \"female\" or \"male.\" Why would Prince, our messiah, our purple nebula, our transcendent femme king, adhere to such trivial, colonialist tripe as the gender binary or stereotypical masculinity when he was not even a child of this galaxy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The boxes that we are ascribed, as black folks, queer folks, femmes, and artists require that we lop off parts of ourselves to fit into them; there is no room for our brilliance, for our full, ridiculous selves. Prince would perform no such surgery. He was our science non-fiction, magic realism come alive and rattling my auntie's walls in Washington Park, permitting me to be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words belong to the definers, not the defined. And here he was, refusing any putative definition of man or woman at all, and eventually, saying he would own the fruits grown from his black voice and body and hands. He had always dwelled beyond the spectrum of gender, but then he remade himself, shed a layer or four, wicked the dew from his gorgeous wings and decided that there were no words worthy of him; we could have him only as a symbol which exists beyond what our mortal, lazy tongues could shape. He wasn’t even human; his voice slithered from his throat in computerized lulls on \"Computer Blue,\" moments after Wendy and Lisa had an exchange I was too young to understand, but I knew that when Lisa asked, \"Shall we begin?\" a million nerve endings, from my eyes to my ankles, screamed \"yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always hated sports. Not only because I find them dull, but because the tensions and anxieties of sports fandom make me nauseous, force my stomach to lilt and shift as wildly as prince on the floor during \"Darling Nikki.\" As a girl, everyone around me loved Michael Jordan, the black boy who could fly, but I knew his secret. Michael was just a man, made of water and salt and bone like the rest of us. One wrong twist of his ankle on his way back to earth, a fall or push from his measly components could be enough to smash his knees to dust and render him flightless, earth stranded. Prince was a magic I could believe in. He was omniscient, conceptual, in the way that queerness always has been, he existed beyond the realm of human, corporal frailties. He wasn’t a man, he was an assemblage of purple energy bound within a lovely frame, that which could never be lost or destroyed. But even the sun will eventually burn out, leave us alone to the cold dark. I am stumbling around in the dark now, searching for trails of soft purple beams of light to guide me.\n"

      "What if society treated consuming marijuana the same way we treat caffeine? Instead of starting off your Sunday morning with a cup of coffee, you'd pour a steamy weed-infused drink. Maybe when you're taking a walk through the park, that latte in your hand actually has a small dose of cannabis in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef Michael Cirino, who has a background in molecular gastronomy and food science, believes weed edibles will eventually transform our leisure time — if we can solve one big problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've ever tried weed edibles before, you know that getting the wrong dosage is an all-too-common issue. Often, you take too much or too little; a slightly too-big bite of chocolate can put you under the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cirino believes that by combining his cooking with scientific research, \"we can self-dose ourselves like we do with caffeine,\" he said during a cooking demonstration April 6 at the Brooklyn Kitchen in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a unique benefit to eating, rather than smoking, marijuana. When the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, is metabolized in the liver, it turns into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is supposedly more psychoactive. This gives weed edibles a demonstrably \"different\" high — longer, steadier, but not necessarily more intense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cirino's goal is to let people dose themselves to enjoy a steady high for a long period of time, as opposed to smoking a joint, whose high spikes and then falls away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the reason why many people who use marijuana medically prefer to eat it, according to the Daily Beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "But cooking with marijuana is intimidating — it's even produced a few horror stories. But proper knowledge of decarboxylation, or heating up the marijuana plant to activate its psychoactive delta 9-THC, can make it a more widely embraced practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decarboxylation can be done in an oven, pressure cooker or stovetop double boiler, according to Cirino. Then you can infuse the cannabinoids into a fat like butter or oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For proper dosing, Cirino recommends 1 gram of cannabis for every 20 to 25 grams of solvent for a cocktail-like strength, and 1 gram for every 30 to 50 grams solvent for a coffee-like strength. People should wait about one and a half to two hours to re-dose.\n",

      "Area 51, a U.S. governmental site located in Nevada, has inspired some grand theories regarding extraterrestrial life and UFOs for decades. And recently, the head administrator of the NASA confirmed the facility exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is an Area 51. It's not what many people think. I've been to a place called that but it's a normal research and development place,\" Charles Bolden, who has led NASA since 2009, said, according to the Telegraph. \"I never saw any aliens or alien spacecraft or anything when I was there. I think because of the secrecy of the aeronautics research that goes on there it's ripe for people to talk about aliens being there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why 7 Experts Are Convinced Alien Life Might Really Exist\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the head of NASA said that there is nothing strange about Area 51. Seems like an open and shut case. However, the former astronaut very clearly said that he \"never saw any aliens or alien space craft.\" It would appear that he could simply not be privy to the inner workings of Area 51.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former employee released \"secret\" Area 51 information. In 2014, a former scientist who claims to have worked within Area 51 named Boyd Bushman gave an interview with engineer Mark Patterson, just before he died. In the now-deleted video, Bushman claimed that he specialized in \"reverse-engineering alien UFO technology for the military,\" according to Tech Times. He also described the secret military base as hosting aliens, who come from the planet \"Quintumnia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are two groups of aliens. They divide them into two groups,\" the deceased scientist said in the interview, according to the NY Daily News. \"One group are wranglers, and the others are rustlers – the ones who are stealers of cattle. The two groups act differently. The ones that are wranglers are much more friendly, and have a better relationship with us.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So much of an interest, in fact, that he spoke to Clinton about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has made me personally pledge we are going to get the information out,\" Clinton said, according to the Conway Daily Sun. \"One way or another. Maybe we could have, like, a task force to go to Area 51.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Podesta probably hopes to uncover the conspiracy theories that have surrounded the facility; one of the most popular being that Area 51 hides the remains of UFOs that crash-landed to Earth. Area 51 conspiracy theorists believe that scientists and researchers are recruited to the secret military base in order to reverse-engineer the extraterrestrial technology, and that the government is covering it all up. Other theories include fancier possibilities, like the creation of weather control technology, time travel and teleportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, the CIA confirmed the existence of Area 51, but made no mention about any grand conspiracy theories regarding aliens or UFOs, according to CNN. The released document instead confirmed that the secret military base is \"a testing site for the government's U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs.\"\n",

      "If you encourage someone to end their life by suicide, or neglect to stop them going through with it, are you inherently implicated for their death? Michelle Carter, who encouraged her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to kill himself, is at the center of an involuntary manslaughter charge over his 2014 death and could face up to 20 years of imprisonment if convicted. Massachusetts' highest court will be hearing arguments Thursday on whether the case against Carter will go forward.\n",

      "\n",
      "Roy and Carter had met each other in Florida, though their two-year relationship was mostly over the phone. Roy had social anxiety and was severely depressed, according to Boston.com. Carter, who was also afflicted with an eating disorder, dissuaded Roy from seeking help during the days prior to his death, and proposed that he \"just do it,\" instead of belaboring and talking about killing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defense's argument: Carter's attorney, Joseph Cataldo argues that Carter's actions didn't constitute serious bodily harm, arguing that Roy's decision to end his life by suicide had already been made through his own volition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All [Carter] did is talk to someone,\" Cataldo said, according to Boston.com. \"[Roy] got the generator. He took all the necessary steps ... He ignored her repeated attempts to dissuade him from killing himself for a good month prior to him ending his own life.\" Cataldo also argued that the prosecutors were trying to criminalize Carter's texts and phone conversations, which are covered by the First Amendment.\n",

      "Carter is being charged as a youthful offender, and the result of her trial can have longterm ramifications in future decisions and prosecutions, even in lesser cases.

      "Can Science Explain Noah's Ark? Why Logic Thoroughly Debunks the Biblical Story\n",
      "The Bible is filled with impossible phenomena, but one that has constantly been imitated in pop culture and discussed in the scientific community is the believability of Noah's Ark. The purported ark would have been able to hold two of every animal on board, and that's obviously a ton of space. However, there are some merits for the plausible existence of the ark, as well as overwhelming evidence to suggest it would've been an impossible creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're gonna need a bigger boat: One of the biggest issues with Noah's Ark would have been the wide selection of animals aboard the boat. According to the Bible, you have the likes of lions and llamas, heavy animals but nothing too crazy. However, when factoring in the likes of dinosaurs, which would have been on the ship as well (Some Creationists will agree dinosaurs did exist, somehow to fit within the 6,000 year existence of Earth according to Genesis), the weight would've been too much to sustain. Not to mention, you'd have eight people on board to take care of all these animals — no easy task.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That would mean, for example, the brachiosaurus (two of them, of course), each of which weighed about 50 tons and reached 85 feet (26 meters) long,\" Benjamin Radford wrote for LiveScience. \"Even if two representatives all of Earth's animals could somehow fit on the ark, enough space would be needed for drinking water and food for an entire year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Russell Crowe certainly made it look doable in Noah.\n",
      "\n",
      "It just had to float, doe: It's important to remember that the ark wouldn't have needed to be steered anywhere; it was merely going to withstand the flood. With that in mind, postgraduate physics students at the University of Leicester confirmed through their metrics that the boat would have remained afloat, based on how big it would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the study, with the approximate ark measurement of 472 feet, it would have been able to hold up to 70,000 animals on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't think of the Bible necessarily as a scientifically accurate source of information, so I guess we were quite surprised when we discovered it would work,\" student Thomas Morris said in an interview with the Independent. \"We're not proving that it's true, but the concept would definitely work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, until you consider that a recent scientific study posited that there are 6.5 million different species of land animals on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Bill Nye isn't convinced: The Science Guy is willing to shut down any discussions about the feasibility of the ark, however — and he certainly has the credentials to do so. During his widely publicized debate against creationist Ken Ham at the Creation Museum in Kentucky, the nearly three-hour long debate eventually moved to the subject of Noah's Ark.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Noah himself, Nye questioned his craftsmanship and ability to create such a vessel, particularly when he had to house so many animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it reasonable that Noah and his family were able to maintain 14,000 animals and themselves on a ship ... that was bigger than anyone's been able to build?\" Nye questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it turns out some people still think it's reasonable. Despite this takedown from the acclaimed scientist, the subject actually sparked additional funding for the museum's Noah's Ark Encounter project, which will create a life-sized replica of the ark housed at the museum. With that extra funding, the boat is expected to be completed in the summer of 2016, and will eventually feature a zoo to accompany it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, our gut is to go with what Nye thinks, and that means the story of Noah's Ark is just that: a story.\n"

      "Why I'm Determined to See My Child With Down Syndrome Go to Public School\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a proud product of public school, and I am determined to usher my children through public school, as well, in spite — or perhaps because — of the fact my oldest has intellectual and developmental delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we learned about our son's Down syndrome (Ds) diagnosis prenatally, we worried about everything from his heart (kids with Down syndrome often have varying levels of heart troubles) to his ability to make friends. The more we learned, the more we also mulled over how to give him the best education possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living paycheck to paycheck made that decision somewhat easier, because we knew private school wasn't an option. We tossed our hat into the charter school ring and wound up at the end of a 500-strong waiting list. But neither choice felt 100% right. I thought, who isn't holding our school district to a high enough standard for our children with different abilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "What really gelled my dedication to sticking with public school was watching the slow trickle of families of children with special needs in our school district move to surrounding counties for \"better services.\" Well, sometimes the grass only looks greener, and soon most voiced renewed and similar struggles. Besides, we love where we live, and we love our community. We didn't want to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were the anecdotes. \"Oh, I've never seen [our school district] put a child with Down syndrome in general curriculum,\" a pediatrician told us. \"[Your school district] is known for putting its head in the sand when it comes to kids with disabilities,\" a therapist told us. \"It's all about money. Kids with disabilities are expensive. I think they just hope we all go somewhere else,\" a mom shared with me. Every hair on this mama bear's head spiked.\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The truth is, the community of children with Down syndrome is small. It's easy to see how a school district can justify putting our children's needs below a larger community — for example, autistic children. But we all know being in the minority should never diminish our value or seat at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't we?\n",
      "\n",
      "I've researched Down syndrome for almost six years now, and while I can never claim to be an expert, I've never found study results that show children with Down syndrome thrive in self-contained classes — i.e., smaller classes of only other children with disabilities. When I wrote about the benefits of inclusion (which means including a child with a disability in a classroom of neurotypical children), I connected with some of our country's top advocates for children with Down syndrome: men and women who had changed law, education policy and mindsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they could do that for a swath of the country, couldn't I do that for my own child's small community?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, here we are. Charlie is included about 79% of the time in a general education kindergarten class — and in our home school, which brings the advantage of developing friendships with children who live in our community. He uses a combination of word approximations, signs and an impressive variety of facial expressions to convey his wants and needs. He calls his classmates his \"fens\": friends. \"Bye, fens!\" he shouts as we drive past kids still waiting to be picked up at the end of the day. Every returned wave, smile or chorus of, \"Byyyye, Charlieeeeeee!\" tells me we're doing the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frustration is that we feel like the school district isn't setting him up to succeed. He has bitten, kicked and scratched his teacher — this isn't behavior we see at home. All behavior is communication, and he's tired and stressed. His little body has to work harder than the other kids to make it through the day, and this is the first year where he doesn't have a built-in nap time. He is exhausted by the end of the day, and his behavior declines as the day goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Courtesy of Maureen Rich Wallace\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is helping his school team understand how effective inclusion can work. It's not about \"dumbing down\" a lesson plan. It's about meeting each child's needs for that curriculum. While one group of kids is learning to write nouns and verbs together, Charlie can work on matching nouns and verbs. It takes time, patience and creativity, but effective inclusion has proven to be the best scenario for both children with disabilities and their typically developing peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has it been easy? I'm sure that answer is relative. My husband and I have taken turns tearing up during conferences and Individualized Education Meetings, calming each other at home and reaching out to various resources for more perspective. We are encouraged by Charlie's team this year, all young educators who perhaps have a touch of uninformed optimism (like us) but who (like us) are determined to make this work. Passion for a child can drive so much, but dedication to doing the right thing must originate with leadership when it comes to successful inclusion in education. Everyone deserves to be treated equally, and Charlie deserves to learn alongside his peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doing it right\" means ensuring a child like ours receives support, services and a team who believes in him. We need every cog in the education wheel to be all in: the superintendent; her staff; our principal; each educator and even a cafeteria worker who either understands the value of letting Charlie choose his own food or does it for him because it's faster. It's easier to just push him through the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Successful inclusion is hard. So is parenthood. Shouldn't we all be held to the same standard of dedication to getting it right?\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not giving up.\n"

      "5 Everyday Phrases That Actually Have Racist Origins\n",
      "As the years go by, certain words and phrases take on new meanings. But some seemingly harmless terms actually stem from hurtful, racist origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Understanding where these words and phrases come from is an important part of understanding how racism and oppression have shaped the world we live in today,\" Francesca Ramsey, host of the weekly MTV series Decoded, said of these secretly racist phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the terms have different meanings today, society should at the very least know the origins of these common phrases that frequently pop up in casual conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long Time, No See\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually meant as a greeting when someone sees a person they have not seen in a long time, the phrase \"long time, no see\" stems from other origins. The phrase was once used to make fun of Native Americans and their use of the English language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another phrase imitative of the syntax of pidgin English, long time no see was originally meant as a humorous interpretation of a Native American greeting, used after a prolonged separation,\" according to the Oxford Dictionaries blog. \"The current earliest citation recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) comes from W.F. Drannan's book Thirty-one Years on Plains (1901): 'When we rode up to him [sc. an American Indian] he said: 'Good mornin. Long time no see you.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thug\n",
      "\n",
      "The word thug, which is often used synonymously with the words \"gangster\" or \"criminal,\" is sometimes used to refer to black Americans unfairly. The use of the word spiked during the Baltimore riots, despite the true origins of the word having nothing to do with blacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As far as I can tell, thug goes back to the 14th Century,\" Megan Garber wrote in her piece \"The History of 'Thug'\" for the Atlantic. She noted that the term likely traces back to an India-based network of criminals that existed for centuries called the Thuggee, who were so feared that even Mark Twain wrote of their exploits in his book Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Itis\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The itis\" is used to describe that lethargic, sleepy feeling an individual gets after eating a large meal. However, the phrase originates from the word \"niggeritis,\" which helped reinforce the stereotype that black Americans were lazy. The scientific term for the phenomenon is referred to as postprandial sleepiness, or somnolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call a Spade a Spade\n",
      "\n",
      "The origin of the phrase \"call a spade a spade\" is a little more unclear. According to NPR, it may be an evolved form of the saying \"to call a fig a fig and a trough a trough,\" which was used in ancient Greece.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the phrase took on a new meaning when people started using the word \"spade\" to refer to black Americans. According to the Huffington Post, use of the word \"spade\" gradually became a racist word to describe blacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Peanut Gallery\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever someone says that they didn't ask for comments from \"the peanut gallery,\" or from someone not involved in the discussion, they probably aren't aware of the origins of the term. The peanut gallery refers to the cheap, undesirable seats in segregated theaters and sporting events where black Americans were required to sit.\n",

      "Just hours after former NYPD Officer Peter Liang had his manslaughter charge reduced and was sentenced to five years of probation and 800 hours of community service for shooting Akai Gurley in a Brooklyn stairwell, a coalition of Chinese-American community groups from across the country sent out a damning statement deploring the Brooklyn District Attorney's decision.\n",

      "The statement continued: \"For more than a year, Akai Gurley's family has been courageously speaking out to demand justice for their loved one. Judge Chun's sentencing decision today is an insult to Akai Gurley, his family, and all victims of police violence. Any amount of jail/prison time is a brief snippet of time compared to the lifetime Akai Gurley's young daughters will have to live without their father. The sentencing sends the message that it is okay to kill innocent and precious lives, as long as it is done by a police officer.\"\n",

      "Rock and Roll is the “People’s Music,” so in honor of this week’s induction ceremony, I thought it would be nice to ask a handful of “people” which acts they believe should be elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Besides, my doctor and I enjoy talking about these matters. He says it helps with my treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked a variety of people, but mostly rock writers wrote back. (As if making a list requires anyone to write!) I didn’t solicit comments, since I didn’t want this blog to read like the “Deluxe and Expanded Re-Mastered Version of War and Peace.” For my own list, I grabbed some names that didn’t make the others. I wrote up the 20 entries that caught my eye. But don’t take that to mean that the other suggestions are any less deserving.\n",

      "20) Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes: I’ve had to check the list several times to make sure the Blue Notes were not admitted. That’s how hard it is to believe. Listen, I know Philly is one of those cities that always gets dumped on, but you can’t argue with Philly Soul. Besides, the Hall itself is located in Cleveland, so it’s not like it doesn’t understand the plight of the underdog.\n",
      "\n",
      "19) Captain Beefheart: Average people like to claim that Rock Critics are an elitist, snotty bunch with too much control. But clearly that is not true because the great Captain has gotten great reviews and sold very few records and is nowhere near the Hall of Fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "18) The Cure: It’s really annoying how many great British bands have been left out of the Hall. Sure, most of the 1960s bands all got in, but after that, no Brits need apply. The Cure were so incredibly versatile. I also vote for Bauhaus and the Sisters of Mercy. Just think — a Goth wing! No windows and you could save a bundle on lighting!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "16) Journey: OK, OK, I’ve been less than kind to them in the past. But I’m not everyone. And Yahoo Music’s own Lyndsey Parker certainly knows what the men don’t understand. I’m more partial to letting in her beloved faves Duran Duran, since they were an important part of early MTV. But just as your favorite musical acts made an indelible impression on you when you were a small person, so did Journey on young Lyndsey. Miss L remains a hardcore music junkie. That’s more than you can say for most people. She cares!\n",

      "\n",
      "14) Big Star: How the Hall can continue to ignore the “marginal” figures who have kept the flame alive for so many is just another chapter in a book I never intend to write! (Too busy listening to music.)\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Buzzcocks: I guess the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash, and Stooges are all we need to know of punk. It might have helped if these guys were signed to Sire.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Brian Eno: Brian is known to many people, except, I suppose, to those people voting in the real Hall. But really? Roxy Music isn’t in? And neither is Eno? Can’t U2 or Talking Heads do anything about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Love: Whenever you realize Arthur Lee and Love are not in the Hall, just remind yourself that U2 and the Eagles made it.\n",

      "Inspired to speak out amidst the recent surge in anti-LGBT legislation around the country, Target wanted to make sure we all understand their views on how people should be treated, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity. In a blog post from Tuesday (I KNOW, TARGET HAS A BLOG, IT'S MY DREAM TOO), Target emphasized their support of the federal Equality Act and clarified that everyone should be able to use the restroom that best fits their gender identity when shopping for bargain housewares, groceries, and bathing suits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "From the blog post:\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent debate around proposed laws in several states has reignited a national conversation around inclusivity. So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It's something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a time when LGBT rights are being questioned and threatened at such a visceral pace, seeing a national chain like Target make such an open declaration of equality on an issue as heated as restroom politics is great. But of course, because haters can't help themselves, people have started voicing serious dissatisfaction about Target's inclusive restroom policy. Some are posting comments directly to Target's Facebook page, and others are rallying behind the hashtag #BoycottTarget. There's also an actual pledge for this, which, like ... why? Don't you guys have jobs? I'm so confused! But please don't bother explaining the logic behind this to me, because I really do not care, bye!\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. I wonder if any of these alleged boycotters are aware that Target has long had a reputation for being LGBT-friendly. Last August, the store announced an initiative to move away from \"gender-based signs\" that suggest who products like bedding and toys are for. And then a month later, in September 2015, Target announced official support of the federal Equality Act. So it's unclear if the restroom thing was just too far for these folks, or if they just mistakenly believed — all this time — that Target was on whatever political team it is that they belong to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, guys! Feel free to boycott if that's what you want. Shorter lines for the rest of us, who are aware of all the very reputable data that shows allowing people to use the restroom that makes them feel the most comfortable isn't actually harmful to anybody.\n",

That said, this lip shade leaves no room for error when applying it, as it is nearly impossible to get off, but it was so worth the challenge as the color is gorgeous. Bottom line: I am more than willing to sacrifice the moisture of my lips to wear this lip color any day.\n",

      "The FCC voted 3-2 along party lines to open up the program called “Lifeline” to broadband Internet service. The Lifeline subsidy is used by about 12 million Americans who qualify for federal assistance programs like Medicaid and food stamps.

      "FCC Wants To Make Broadband Faster:\n",

As of Friday morning, more than 670 people were \"attending\" on Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The date is the anniversary of last year's much debated removal of the flag by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, which was in reaction to the Charleston Shooting. \"Our treacherous state Legislature voted to remove it without the consent of the people in our state,\" the event's invitation read, according to the State. \"We, however, owe this opportunity to them. Without their poor judgment and lack of integrity, we would not have this cause.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "James Bessenger, the Secessionist Party founder, wants the controversial rally to become an annual event, honoring the soldiers of the Civil War. \"We do it to honor those who left their homes, left their families, stood on bloody battlefields and sacrificed their lives for the sake of the people of South Carolina,\" he told the State.\n",

      "\n",
      "On June 22, Haley announced the flag was coming down after flying since 1962.

      "\n",
      "Haley had reinstated the group's lost ability to celebrate the anniversary of the state's secession from the Union on the State House's grounds in December, according to the State.

      "Tour Confidential: Tiger’s Potential Return, John Daly’s HOF Case\n",
      "Every Sunday night, GOLF.com conducts an e-mail roundtable with writers from Sports Illustrated and Golf Magazine. Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors and join the conversation in the comments section below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. John Daly will start a new chapter in his career this week when he makes his Champions tour debut at the Insperity Invitational outside of Houston. Looking back at what Daly has accomplished—two major wins and an Everyman, grip-it-and-rip-it appeal that has brought untold new fans to the game—does JD deserve consideration for a bust in the World Golf Hall of Fame?\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Bamberger, senior writer, Sports Illustrated: For sure. Fred getting in really lowered the bar. Angel Cabrera is getting in, too. Zach Johnson, yes. (Dustin Johnson, show us something, would you?) Davis: no brainer. I’d wait on Daly. The senior career can have more weight if we use to measure a player’s achievements. The three senior majors are serious business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark Godich, senior editor, Sports Illustrated (@MarkGodich): Andy North says hello. Daly has only five PGA Tour victories, and the boorish behavior has to be taken into account, doesn’t it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gary Van Sickle, senior writer, Sports Illustrated (@GaryVanSickle): The fact that John Daly never qualified for a Ryder Cup team, nor was chosen for one, says it all. Hall of Fame? Nope.\n",
      "\n",
      "[tile:2448635]\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Passov, senior editor, Golf Magazine (@joepassov): If the World Golf Hall of Fame creates a Novelty Wing, sort of a sideshow attraction, John Daly is a slam dunk. Otherwise, forget it. I loved watching JD gripping it and ripping it, both in his heyday and beyond. However, the same issues that kept him from making a single Ryder Cup team, despite two majors, will keep him out of the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff Ritter, digital development editor, Sports Illustrated Golf Group (@Jeff_Ritter): I think he’s close. Two major titles are obviously big. My hall of fame test is, “Is this golfer’s career important to the story of the game of golf?” Daly’s win at the ’91 PGA at Crooked Stick was seismic, and he backed it up at a St. Andrews Open. Of course he’s also a colorful character and hugely popular, and I believe that matters at least a little to the HOF (call it the “Freddie Effect”). I think with a senior career that’s even modestly successful, he’s in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Josh Sens, contributing writer, GOLF Magazine (@JoshSens): Strictly speaking, his record qualifies him, but induction at this point doesn’t feel quite right. That said, I like the idea of the Novelty Wing (weird swings, crazy nicknames, madcap antics). If they ever do build it, that’s where I’d spend the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: Now that would be fun, Josh. Maybe that’s our next project: Nominations for the Novelty Wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: Ok. I’ll start, Joe. Tommy “Two Gloves” Gainey. Word has it he plays with two gloves. Or maybe Eamonn Darcy for a swing that makes Furyk’s look conventional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: Josh, I’ll give you 10-time Tour winner Ky Laffoon (once took a pistol from his trunk and shot his putter three times) and Johnny Bulla (thrice a runner-up in majors, he played with a golf ball sold at Walgreens) and raise you a Moe Norman, the eccentric Canadian. When once told the hole was a “Drive and an 8-iron,” he hit 8-iron from the tee, then smoked a driver onto the green.\n",

      "SCORES: The Latest From a Rainy Zurich Classic\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Davis Love III told our Ryan Asselta last week that he would consider making Tiger Woods a playing-captain at the Ryder Cup in September if Woods returns this season and is “playing well.” If you’re in Love’s shoes, how well would Woods need to be playing for you to use one of your four picks on him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberger: As Dan Rather used to say, the chances of Tiger playing in the RC this year are slim and none, and slim just left town. But Davis is giving the man a goal, and that’s what a friend does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: Slim just called to say that Tiger would need to stay healthy, win at least one event and show well in several others before being seriously considered. And then he hung up on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godich: Agree with Michael. I don’t know how Davis could be any more vague with the criteria. And are you really going to burn a pick on a guy whose back could go out at any moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: No matter how unlikely it might appear right now that Tiger will be in that kind of form by August, it can’t hurt to dangle that carrot. Having said that, the exhausting amount of speculating and second-guessing about captain’s picks should be extinguished as soon as possible. Yes, it gives us all something to talk about, but those picks have had zero positive effect on U.S. outcomes over the past decade. We’d be better off picking out of a hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: Also, let’s remember the context: Love was asked the question. He didn’t bring it up out of the blue. Once faced with query, he gave the only possible answer he could. No upside to issuing a flat-out ‘no.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: Tiger would have to win or string so many top-5 finishes together that his consistency was unmistakable. One mistake most of the older (and losing) American Ryder Cup captains has been picking players who were their contemporaries thinking they still played like the guy they remembered, not the guy they are now. So Tiger would have to prove plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Whispers that Tiger Woods might return to the Tour at the Wells Fargo Championship next week proved to be just that. From what you’ve seen and heard from Woods over the past couple of weeks, when do you think we will see him back in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godich: He’ll be back for a tournament at which he has ridiculous success: the Memorial. It will give him a gauge of where his game is heading into Oakmont.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberger: Players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: Barring a setback, Woods won’t stay on the sidelines for a second consecutive major championship. That means either Bamberger or Godich will soon be proven correct. And whichever event it is, it might as well go ahead and add Ringling Brothers as a title sponsor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: I watched him up close at the Bluejack National opening this past Monday, playing his first holes since August. It was fun to see him swinging away, walking without a limp. Yet, he admitted to David Feherty that he was rusty, and that his speed and power needed to come back. He’s just about there, but a month sounds about right. I’ll go with Mark’s pick of Memorial, the first week of June.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: The Players would be nice. He could keep the driver in the bag and the jet in the hangar. But given the rust and power issues he acknowledges, Jack’s place does seem about right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: Let me know when Tiger plays 18 holes of golf, anywhere, four days in a row. Then he can think about coming back. Will that happen in the next week in time for the Players? I don’t know. I’ll go with The Memorial. It gives him a big test before the U.S. Open to see if he’s ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Kevin Kisner was suspended from his home club, Palmetto Golf Club in Aiken, S.C., for filming a Vice Sports video that showed him and his buddies racing golf carts and guzzling beers at the club. Did the punishment fit the crime?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberger: I don’t know, but it hurts. Palmetto is about as pure as it gets. But I’m sure he can get on the public Aiken Golf Club course, also a gem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godich: Absolutely. It wasn’t exactly Mr. Kisner’s finest moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: I’m completely confused as to how this “video” was greenlighted in the first place. I mean, the club had to know about it, right? After watching the video, I wasn’t appalled with anything, even as I’ll defend any club’s rights to enforce its rules. Sure, it was boys acting like boys, but they didn’t do anything that isn’t done at any other club I know of. Maybe the cart race at the beginning was foolish, as somebody really could get hurt, or property damaged … but drinking beer? Gambling? At Bushwood? In Casablanca? I’m shocked, shocked!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: As John Daly once said, “I hate them rules and crap.” But the club has every right to have them and to enforce them. Kisner being a Tour pro gives him no special exemption. Guys in his salary bracket already get enough of them around tax time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: Right, Josh. It’s totally up to the club. And doesn’t Aiken have a go-kart track?\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: I’m not sure what was dumber: doing what Kisner and his pals did or posting it online. I think the punishment fit the crime for doing it. For posting it online, I’d kick his butt out of the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Golf stats whiz Mark Broadie computed the win probability for a hypothetical golfer with a fixed skill at most of the PGA Tour stroke-play events from 2011-15. His conclusion: The PGA Championship is the toughest tournament to win. Do you agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberger: I like Mark Broadie’s initials. I am bored by the effort to turn golf into a game played on paper. What does the phrase even mean? Not much to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godich: It’s tough to answer a question that you can’t comprehend, but logic tells me that any event that includes 20 club professionals can’t be the toughest to win. I’ll take the Players Championship, only because the World Golf Ranking (flawed as it might be) tells us it features the strongest field in golf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: My middle name is Mark. Does that count for something? Anyway, I’m with the two old guys here, MB and MG, that are a bit mystified by the conclusion. My problem comes with defining the terms. “Toughest to win,” may have one conclusion by Mr. Brodie’s measures, but we don’t have to buy it. I’ll argue the Players has the best field, which would fit one definition of “toughest,” but my pick is the U.S. Open. Even with all of those qualifiers and regional amateurs and such, a typical U.S. Open serves up the most demanding test. Combine that with the implications from winning–you would be the U.S. Open champion–makes it the “toughest” for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: No other event punishes the field like the U.S. Open, so I like Joe’s pick. I’d also single out the Masters, which may not boast the same strength of field, but I seem to recall that Augusta’s intense Sunday pressure can occasionally produce some surprising finishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: I’m with Joe. You combine the magnitude of the event with the difficulty of the setup and the quality of the field and, well, I’m not crunching any numbers here, but that’s a sum total that I can pretty much eyeball. U.S. Open gets my nod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: I could not disagree more with Mr. Broadie. Due to the usual summer heat, the PGA’s greens are usually watered to keep them alive. Thus the greens are receptive. You saw Jason Day get to 20 under par last summer at Whistling Straits, a record score, and he needed it to beat Jordan Spieth. I don’t know how you define toughest to win but since the PGA often has the easiest scoring conditions, it’s definitely not the toughest. The U.S. Open is more difficult, the Masters has more pressure and risky holes and the British Open carries the weight of history. I don’t get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. We’re four months through the calendar year. What’s been the biggest surprise on the PGA Tour in 2016?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bamberger: Jim Herman’s win (positive). Jordan’s seven on 12 at Augusta (negative).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: Jordan’s swing after taking the drop on 12, and the resulting welcome-mat-sized divot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Godich: Raise your hand if you didn’t concede the Masters to Jordan Spieth after he holed the birdie putt at the 9th hole on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passov: Raise your other hand if you thought Adam Scott would be leading the FedEx Cup point standings, by a wide margin, heading into May. By the way, I had to look that up. I just knew that Scott was enjoying a superb season, much to my surprise. I figured without his anchored putter, he was as good as done. Instead, he’s resembled the guy we saw in 2013. We just won’t see him in the Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sens: For shock on the Richter scale, nothing matches Spieth’s disaster at 12 on Sunday, though Ernie’s six-putt on the opening hole was a very sad stunner. Not an earth-shattering surprise, but seeing both Fowler and Mickelson miss the cut at Augusta was unexpected, as was Rory’s fade to black on the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ritter: Good point on Ernie, Josh. “Six-putting” was a concept I had never previously considered. Now I think about it often while standing over my own 40-footers. Good times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: I agree with Joe. I didn’t think Scott would be competitive once he gave up the long stick. His wins were remarkable and proved me wrong. I haven’t seen many other ex-belly putters rise up, though, so I guess we will see. Scott stands as the pleasant surprise of the year.\n",

      "Samantha Bee: Harriet Tubman Should Be on the Twenty, Jackson a \"Genocidal Prick\"\n",
      "On the most recent edition of, Full Frontal, comedian Samantha Bee waded into the surprisingly contentious debate over whether to replace the United States' seventh president on the $20 bill with American abolitionist Harriet Tubman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman, an escaped slave who helped so many others to freedom that she was known in her own lifetime as \"Moses,\" has long been sought by activists looking to oust Jackson, whose most famous accomplishments included the forced relocation of Native Americans (known as the Trail of Tears) and destroying the country's Second National Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we make such a dramatic change to something no one ever looks at, we have to consider the fragile feelings of white men,\" said Bee, before pivoting. \"Where on earth could I find a white man sharing his feelings?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee turned to perennial liberal punching-bag Fox News and specifically Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade, who had mounted a defense of Jackson last week on his show. \"Ousting a past president who has done so much in the founding of our country,\" Kilmeade admonished, would be an \"unbelievable sign of disrespect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Jackson did participate in the American revolution, he played no role in the founding events of the United States. \"He was not a Founding Father,\" said Bee. \"He was a genocidal prick who forced the relocation of nonwhites and fomented populist rebellion — kind of like a Trump with better hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee closed out the sketch with an exploration of other ideas like former presidential candidate, Dr. Ben Carson's suggestion that Tubman be placed on the $2 bill or even more radical ideas that a new bill be created for her like the $25 or $12 bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah, that would be something,\" said Bee. \"Make the black person worth exactly 3/5 of the white person's value. Gee, why hasn't anybody ever thought of that before.\"\n",

      "Donald Trump is Wrong — Harriet Tubman Belongs on the $20 Bill\n",
      "The US Treasury’s move this week to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the front of the $20 bill is significant for a number of reasons, although some, including Donald Trump, have disagreed. First, a woman is replacing a man. Second, a black person is replacing a white person. Third, an abolitionist and anti-slavery activist is replacing a former slaveholder. But there is a fourth and ultimately even more important rationale.\n",
      "\n",
      "With change afoot in the US currency, it is not difficult to see why Jackson would inspire little loyalty. Though he was a war hero who served as the nation’s seventh president and fought successfully to kill the national bank, he also owned hundreds of slaves, supported the forced relocation of Indian tribes, and helped to install the spoils system in US politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman presents a remarkable contrast that makes her seem, at first glance, an unlikely replacement. She was born into slavery and lived in poverty for much of her life. She never learned to read or write. She never commanded an army or won election to any public office. She even suffered from seizures, perhaps as a result of a head injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, in an age when Americans seem particularly enamored of the rich, powerful, and glamorous, Tubman represents an extraordinary anachronism. She was no Donald Trump billionaire, who said on the Today Show on Thursday that he thinks Tubman is “fantastic” — but added the move to have her replace Jackson is “pure political correctness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman also did not aspire to the high political offices of Hillary Clinton, who on Wednesday tweeted: “A woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter. I can’t think of a better choice for the $20 bill than Harriet Tubman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And no one tried to keep up with Tubman in the manner of the Kardashians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in other ways, she was a remarkable human being. An escaped slave, she fought to free other slaves and became one of the nation’s leading abolitionists. At great personal risk, she served as a key figure in the Underground Railroad, helping to lead many to freedom. Testifying to her importance as an opponent of slavery, a fellow abolitionist once dubbed her “Moses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She also became one of the leading figures in the nation’s women’s suffrage movement. She pointed to countless acts of selfless courage by women during the Civil War and throughout history as evidence that women could prove just as noble as men. She believed that race and gender revealed nothing about a human being’s worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such contributions shine even more brightly when we recall the many disadvantages and setbacks in life she had to overcome to play her leadership role in US history. In recounting her feelings as she moved from slavery to freedom, she offered one of the most inspiring accounts of the impulse to serve ever uttered by an American:\n",
      "\n",
      "I had crossed the line of which I had so long been dreaming. I was free; but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a stranger in a strange land, and my home after all was down in the old cabin quarter, with the old folks, and my brothers and sisters. But to this solemn resolution I came; I was free, and they should be free also; I would make a home for them in the North, and the Lord helping me, I would bring them all there.\n",
      "\n",
      "After serving as a Union Spy, becoming the first woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War, and working tirelessly to liberate and support former slaves, Tubman was headed home to New York when she was told by a train conductor to move to another car. When she refused, the conductor and other passengers forcibly removed her, breaking her arm in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we come to the fourth reason Tubman is a great choice: too many government representatives grace US currencies. Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and Grant were all US presidents. Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin, though not, each played huge roles as government leaders – Hamilton as first secretary of the treasury, and Franklin as a diplomat and elder statesman.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a natural tendency for the US government to memorialize its own, but many people who never served in any official capacity have played equally important roles in shaping American culture and charting the history of the United States. Consider, for example, Thomas Paine, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Thomas Edison, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n",
      "\n",
      "The likes of Tubman remind us that wealth, power, and fame are not essential ingredients in the recipe for a life of significance, the kind that enriches and inspires the lives of others. Many Americans will never be chronicled in the pages of Fortune, but each of us can aspire to lead a life that leaves the world a better place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most compelling reason Harriet Tubman belongs on US currency is this: She reminds us that an ordinary person – someone with little money, who holds no lofty political office, commands no army, and lacks natural gifts such as musical talent, and athletic ability – can, through moral imagination and courage, make a difference in the lives of others, even changing the course of history.\n",

      "Joanie Laurer, best known to legions of professional wrestling fans as former WWE diva Chyna, was found dead today in her Los Angeles home. No cause of death has been released for Laurer, who was 45. “It is with deep sadness to inform you today that we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th wonder of the world has passed away,” read a message posted to her Facebook page Wednesday evening. “She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Born December 27, 1970 in Rochester, New York, Laurer became famous in 1997 after joining the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), adopting the name Chyna and billed as “The 9th Wonder Of The World” in tribute to WWE legend Andre the Giant. Wrestling against both women and men, her sexual identity, large stature and tomboy persona presented as the antithesis of the usual diva persona, and she enjoyed spectacular success in pro wrestling for the next four years. She was forced out of WWF in 2001 following a personal conflict with WWE wrestler and executive Stephanie McMahon, returning only sporadically to wrestling after.Famously, she was forced to stop using the name Chyna for a period due to the trademark being owned by WWF – she later filed paperwork to change her name legally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following her wrestling career, she appeared in a small number of pornographic films (she had also modeled for Playboy in 2000, and did so again in 2002), and pursued acting, appearing on episodes of 3rd Rock From The Sun, among other roles. She also found success on reality tv, appearing on Fear Factor, and in various incarnations of The Surreal Life.\n",

      "A cluster of supermassive black holes in deep space are mysteriously aligned, and the new discovery could tell us a lot about how the early universe formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The black holes sit in a distant region of space called ELAIS-N1, and they're all spitting out bursts of radio waves in the same direction. Here you can see the radio bursts all aligned, like needles on compasses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers made the discovery by accident while sifting through data from a three-year radio survey using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in India. The finding was totally unexpected because aligned supermassive black holes that span multiple galaxy clusters don't fit in with any of our theories about how the early universe formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since these black holes don't know about each other, or have any way of exchanging information or influencing each other directly over such vast scales, this spin alignment must have occurred during the formation of the galaxies in the early universe,\" astronomer Andrew Russ Taylor, who worked on the research, said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team thinks cosmic magnetic fields or cosmic strings could be responsible for the alignment. Astronomers will compare this observation with simulations of how the large-scaled structure of the universe formed. It could give them hints about fluctuations in the primordial soup that came from the Big Bang, and why such larges patches of space appear aligned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're beginning to understand how the large-scale structure of the universe came about, starting from the Big Bang and growing as a result of disturbances in the early universe, to what we have today, and that helps us explore what the universe of tomorrow will be like,\" Taylor said in a statement.\n",

Hate it that these, you know, social media stars are now the supermodels in fashion. They are not true supermodels. And the thing is, I have always looked to Vogue magazine to lead the way, not be a follower. I rely on Vogue to set the standard, not follow what everybody else is doing.

      "Well, that didn’t take long.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of people excited about the Oculus Rift, but the hardware maker is already facing a growing backlash from customers who pre-ordered the device and, at this point, have no idea when they’ll get their hands on one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse still, they complain, inquiries to the company are largely being ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was so excited for this week, and Oculus just took a big [expletive deleted] on that,” wrote one frustrated user on Reddit. “I thought this week would be filled with a million unboxing videos and everyone talking about their awesome experiences. Instead we get this. The store opens when almost no one has a Rift, developers must be wondering why no one is buying their games, and now everyone is just angry or frustrated. All I want is communication from Oculus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Oculus did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day before the Rift’s official launch, co-founder and CEO Palmer Luckey promised at the time units would start arriving for Kickstarter backers on Monday followed by customers who pre-ordered later would receive units by mid-week, likely Wednesday. That was quickly followed by a tweet asking buyers to “stay tuned for future updates”.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Twitter, there have been no updates from Luckey, other than a repost of the above Tweet on Thursday. But Luckey has dropped by the Oculus subreddit occasionally throughout the week to address some of the complaints of the Rift’s hard core fan base about the company’s general radio silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t shunt blame to other people, this is my call,” Luckey wrote. “I am not going to wax poetic about this, since I have done so in the past, but bottom-line: I won’t give in-depth updates on any situation without knowing it is solid, true, and finalized. Until I can do so, the best I can do is remind people that I will get them information as quickly as I can. On the rare occasions when things still change, even when they change for reasons out of my control, I get crucified anyway. Sometimes that means updates have to wait until things get locked down, and sometimes that means waiting a little longer to give everyone good info.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While no one knows exactly what’s causing the delays in shipping Rift units, there are some common themes in the complaints. Many buyers whose pre-orders entailed a March delivery insist they have not only not received their Rifts, but they haven’t yet seen the charges show up on their credit cards or received an email saying the order is processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "That could be a problem with the payment provider or a last minute manufacturing issue. Oculus owner Facebook (fb) has never made a mass-market physical product before, which is possibly why units are in such short supply at launch—or it could be something else entirely.\n",

      "Mississippi Ban on Adoption by Same-Sex Couples Declared Unconstitutional by Judge\n",
      "A statewide ban on same-sex couples adopting children in Mississippi was declared unconstitutional Thursday by a federal judge, the Associated Press reported. Mississippi was the last state in the United States to have a ban on adoption by same-sex couples.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan cited the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling in his decision. \"It also seems highly unlikely that the same court that held a state cannot ban gay marriage because it would deny benefits — expressly including the right to adopt — would then conclude that married gay couples can be denied that very same benefit,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan ordered John Davis, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, to stop enforcing the ban, effectively opening the door for LGBT couples to file adoption paperwork as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal challenge to the ban came from four couples who filed a lawsuit in 2015, joined by the Campaign for Southern Equality and the Family Equality Council, seeking to overturn it, the New York Times reported. One of the couples who sued, Kathryn Garner and Susan Hrostowski, have been together for more than 25 years and have a 16-year-old son, Hudson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Thursday's ruling, Garner told the AP the couple planned to file adoption paperwork as early as Friday. \"I am overwhelmed with joy,\" she said. \"For us, this has been a long time in the making.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Human Rights Campaign, citing information from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey, 19% of same-sex couples in the U.S. are raising children. The decision in Mississippi comes as a victory for LGBT families amidst a storm of \"religious freedom\" legislation, laws that effectively legalize anti-LGBT discrimination, in several states.\n",
      "Driver Causes Major Accident While Trying to Use a Snapchat Filter\n",
      "There's a Snapchat filter that shows you how fast your phone is moving. This can be fun when you're running or on a train, but dangerous if you're behind the wheel of a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "A driver trying to attain a high speed on Snapchat is allegedly to blame for a car accident outside of Atlanta, Georgia, that left a victim with \"traumatic brain injuries,\" CNN reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driver, Christal McGee, was driving 107 mph at the time of the collision on September 10, 2015, going over the speed limit \"in order to obtain recognition through Snapchat by means of a Snapchat 'trophy'\", according to the issued complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a statement from the law offices of Michael Lawson Neff, McGee said she was \"Just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the complaint, McGee's Mercedes struck a Mitsubishi being driven by Maynard Wentworth, leaving Wentworth with \"permanent brain damage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maynard and his wife are suing both McGee and Snapchat for medical bills incurred as a result of the accident, CNN reported. Maynard, an Uber driver at the time of the car accident, now relies on a walker or wheelchair.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven't seen Snapchat's speed filter, here's what it looks like in action:\n",
      "\n",
      "It's okay... if you're a passenger. Alexis Kleinman/Mic\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't the first time: McGee isn't the only person to face reckless driving charges as a result of Snapchat — a teen in Washington got into a rollover car crash while using FaceTime and Snapchat behind the wheel. New evidence also points to Snapchat as the possible cause of a car crash in Philadelphia that left three young women dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint issued against McGee also cites an accident in Brazil in which a woman wrecked her car while documenting herself driving 110 mph on Snapchat. The woman snapped a photo of the speedometer prior to the collision with the caption \"180 KM LMAO\" — 180 kilometers per hour equates to 112 miles per hour, just five miles more than the speed McGee was driving when she hit Wentworth's car. The woman in Brazil continued to snap the accident following the impact, posting bloody selfies with the captions translating to \"HELLLLLLLLLPPP\" and \"we overturned the car\".\n",
      "\n",
      "McGee also took a Snapchat following her accident, according to Peagler's statement, snapping a photo of herself in the ambulance with blood on her face with the text, \"Lucky to be alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You've been warned: It's no wonder injury attorneys are warning parents about the dangers of Snapchat's speed filter and Facebook groups like Mothers Against Snapchatting While Driving are being created. There are also some grim anti-snapchat-while-driving ads, showing users the deadly consequences of snapping behind the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This issue is just an extension of the existing problem of texting and driving, only with the Snapchat speed filter, there's another thing tempting users to push the pedal to the metal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snapchat does reportedly display a warning not to snap and drive on its speed filter as well as remind its users to not use its services \"in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws\" and to \"never put yourself or others in harm's way just to capture a Snap,\" but this warning is buried in its Terms of Service. Maybe it should give a trophy for reading that.\n",
      "\n",
      "April 27, 2016, 12:22 p.m.: This article has been updated to clarify that Snapchat includes include a warning not to snap and drive on its speed filter.\n",

      "High-functioning pot aficionados Abbi and Ilana, Bill Maher, and the young Barack Obama would all like a stern word with UC Davis, who released a study last week claiming that stoners tend to be losers. The study, which tracked habitual tokers from childhood to their late 30s, found they ended up in a lower social class than their parents, with lower-paying, less skilled, and less prestigious jobs than those who abstained from the devil's lettuce. Those who embraced the ganja also were found to have more financial, work-related and relationships problem, which only got worse as they aged and their list of Ghosts of 4/20s Past got longer and longer.\n",

      "A well-groomed Trump family worked very hard to put a more genteel face on Donald Trump's erratic and sometimes uncouth campaign Tuesday night, appearing alongside the ruddy-faced candidate in an hour-long town hall with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Perhaps none were more politically astute than Trump's daughter Ivanka, however, who artfully dodged a question about her friendship with Chelsea Clinton and insisted that her dad is great for women.\n",

      "Rumors have been swirling for weeks that, amid a brutal political contest between their parents, Ivanka and Chelsea's friendship has been put on hold. On Tuesday, Trump masterfully evaded a question about whether the competing campaigns — and increasingly personal attacks coming from each candidate— have damaged their relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, look, we're children and we love our parents, so that's the great equalizer, and that's the great common ground,\" Ivanka said, adding, \"So I'm incredibly proud of my father. I'm amazed and truly in awe of what he's accomplished and what he's accomplished throughout the course of his life up until this point.\"\n",

      "Then she spoke about Clinton in a manner that definitely did not make it seem like the two have been chatting lately: \"But, you know, the last 10 months have really been a whole different level.

      "\n",
      "Contrast that language to Clinton's, when she told Cosmopolitan.com in January that \"friendship is more important than politics,\" and that the two do not discuss their parents' campaigns with each other. \"And we were friends before the campaign and I have no doubt that we'll be friends after the campaign,\" she said.\n",

This involved someone who peddled bad information to the Times on the San Bernardino shooters, which followed hard upon the episode in which someone peddled bad information to the Times about how the FBI \"has launched a criminal inquiry\" into HRC's alleged mishandling of classified material. (That is true now, but it wasn't last July, when the story ran.) It was the opinion hereabouts that whoever these sources were, their intentions were far from honorable, and that it was the responsibility of the reporters to out them in order that the public might better judge the motives of the people investigating a former Secretary of State and the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president.\n",

Also, an earlier version of this article reported that 147 FBI agents had been detailed to the investigation, according to a lawmaker briefed by FBI Director James B. Comey.

      "\"Becky\" Is Not a Racial Slur — So You Should Stop Calling Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' Racist\n",
      "After Beyoncé unleashed Lemonade to the world, unloading a concoction of underlying political and sometimes controversial themes, no other line has been as much a catalyst for scandal as \"He better call Becky with the good hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several celebrities have come out in their own defense to reassure fans and the furiously buzzing BeyHive they are not, in fact, the cheating Becky, including fashion designer Rachel Roy, singer Rita Ora and even chef Rachel Ray (who unveiled a lemonade recipe after the implosion).\n",
      "\n",
      "But on Tuesday morning, TV personality Wendy Williams took the term to task: \"Calling a white girl Becky, I have decided — hi, white people — that is not very nice. That's like calling a black girl 'Shaniqua,'\" Williams said. The daytime talk show host then proceeded to call her off-camera producer Susanne \"Becky,\" acknowledging the two use the phrase casually off camera. \"I am not using that word anymore, today is the last day I'll use it, and I encourage everyone else, don't call white girls 'Becky,' that is very hurtful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Becky\" isn't a racial slur. It's always unacceptable for anyone to use a derogatory term to undermine someone based on their skin color — even for Beyoncé. But the name \"Becky\" itself is categorically not a derogatory term for whites— it's a name popularized in pop culture and society to describe someone as \"basic,\" regardless of their skin color. Beyoncé injecting the reference in a song about being cheated on by Jay Z with another woman, and calling that woman Becky, doesn't immediately imply a white woman slept with her husband, but instead, someone she sees as beneath her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"Becky\" has taken on several meanings. Sir Mix-a-Lot popularized the Becky reference in the early '90s in the intro to his critical hit \"Baby Got Back,\" in which two disapproving women can be heard critiquing another woman's figure and style. The term has since been used to describe a multitude of meanings, from suburban yuppies, according to Online Slang Dictionary, to a woman who performs oral sex well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So...do we need to have a talk about why being called Becky is not racist nor remotely a stereotype?\n",
      "\n",
      "Becky is an insult, yes. But it's not racist, and it's the weakest of weak examples of a \"stereotype.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The undermining of the name dates as far back as 1847, in which a novel titled Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray explored the life of Becky Sharp, a woman who climbed the social ranks by charming rich businessmen and collecting their wealth by tricking them into marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while calling someone a \"Becky\" has had negative connotations behind it for years, the backlash of it being a racial slur really only came into existence after Saturday night's HBO premiere of Beyoncé's Lemonade.\n",
      "\n",
      "@_TheCivilRight was this \"Becky\" upset when Beyoncé used the N word in her song? Or only when the racial slur pertained to her and her race\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, those lambasting Beyoncé for including the single line in her 12-track album have yet to mention anything about the singer using actual racial slurs throughout Lemonade.\n"

      "Two years after killing 68-year-old Ernest Satterwhite in North Augusta, South Carolina, here's the punishment Justin Gregory Craven is facing today: three years of probation, 80 days of community service, no jail time and a pretty sweet life ahead of him, considering the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We couldn't ask for a better outcome as far as the sentence is concerned,\" Jack Swerling, Craven's attorney, told reporters Monday, according to Reuters. \"[He] got probation, no house arrest and he's pretty much free to go live his life.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Satterwhite died at a hospital, and Craven was charged with discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle in April 2015 — the same day Michael Slager was charged with murder for shooting Walter Scott, another unarmed black man, two hours east in North Charleston, according to the Washington Post.\n",

      "\n",

      "When you're pregnant, making special requests at a restaurant to make sure you're avoiding certain health risks is just par for the course. That's exactly what an expectant mom named Kassidy Small was attempting to do when she ordered a sandwich at a local Subway restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I walked up to the counter and asked for a footlong ham,\" Small wrote on Facebook. \"I also politely asked that he microwave the meat before toasting the sandwich. Simple request, right? The guy threw a fit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The employee told her he could just toast it for her, which meant she had to explain again that she's pregnant and needed it microwaved first. Small was simply trying to follow CDC guidelines, which recommend that pregnant women only eat deli meat if it's heated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F to steer clear of bacteria (like listeria) that could cause harm to the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He completely ignored my request, made my sandwich, added cheese (which he didn't even ask if I wanted), and threw it in the toaster,\" Small explained. \"He said that there are 20 people in line and he has already made 90 sandwiches today. He then said 'THIS IS FAST FOOD, NOT FINE DINING!' He also attempted to prove that the meat was hot enough by pulling out a thermometer. He was completely out of line, rude, and belittling my request that was in the best interest for my unborn baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Small and another woman who had watched the whole thing go down ended up leaving the restaurant without food. \"I was in tears and that's embarrassing in public,\" Small told FOX6Now. \"It's easy for a pregnant woman to cry but I was also upset because of what just happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, Small took action following the incident, sharing in a comment on her original Facebook post, \"I did file a complaint on the Subway website. It says they will forward it to the store owner. Hopefully she get's [sic] the message and has a 'serious' talk with that employee. I can't imagine treating someone the way he treated me.\"\n",

      "Elizabeth Warren Torches GOP in Blistering Takedown of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz\n",
      "With Republicans embroiled in a civil war over the likely nomination of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz — both scorched-earth outsiders loathed by much of the GOP establishment — Elizabeth Warren has a message for the party: You brought this on yourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Republicans painted themselves into this corner,\" the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote in a Friday op-ed for the Boston Globe. Trump and Cruz, Warren argued, are \"logical outgrowths\" of the GOP's years-long strategy of obstructionism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest case study, Warren observed, is the Senate GOP's refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In nominating Garland, \"[t]he president has done his job, as directed by our Constitution — but Republican senators refuse to do theirs,\" Warren wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Barack Obama won two consecutive elections and has been president for seven years. But since the first day of his presidency, Republican leaders have rejected his legitimacy and abused the rules of the Senate in an all-out effort to cripple the government under his leadership,\" she contended, citing \"artificial debt ceiling crises, deliberate government shutdowns and intentional confirmation blockades.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this have to do with two leading Republican candidates?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are the next logical outgrowth of the same attitude — if you can't get what you want, just ignore the obligations of governing, then divert attention and responsibility by wallowing in a toxic stew of attacks on Muslims, women, Latinos, and each other,\" Warren wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attack dog: Though Warren resisted calls to enter the presidential fray herself, she has become increasingly engaged in the 2016 campaign, even as she has pointedly refused to endorse either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist scourge of big banks and their political benefactors is now directing much of her ire at Republicans — particularly Trump. She's lately taken to calling the billionaire businessman a \"loser,\" appropriating one of his signature insults, and has linked Trump to \"history's worst authoritarians.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversial Republican frontrunner \"stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors,\" she wrote in a recent tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Democrats grow uneasy over the acrimonious primary between Clinton and Sanders — fearing that it may weaken the party against the GOP — Warren's decision to keep the heat on the opposition may prove just as crucial as an endorsement.\n",
      "Why a Judge Ruled North Carolina's Voter-ID Law Constitutional\n",
      "Schroeder, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled that while North Carolina had been on the progressive end of the spectrum of voting, the new rules were simply retrenchment and were constitutional. He said the plaintiff—a group that included the North Carolina NAACP, the Justice Department, and others—“failed to show that such disparities will have materially adverse effects on the ability of minority voters to cast a ballot and effectively exercise the electoral franchise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Schroeder’s decision to uphold the law was not unexpected. The plaintiffs have already vowed to appeal the decision to a federal appeals court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial was held in two phases. The first, which began last July, focused on the early voting, out-of-precinct voting, and same-day registration portions. Because of last-minute changes to the voter-ID section of the law—legislators created a process by which voters could cast a ballot by swearing they had a “reasonable impediment” to getting a photo ID—a trial about the ID requirement was not held until January. Schroeder upheld both halves of the law in his ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voting law was passed shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act that required certain states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to receive “pre-clearance” from the Justice Department before changing their voting laws. While Republicans had been considering changes already, the ruling allowed them to expand their ambition. “Now we can go with the full bill,” Senator Tom Apodaca, chairman of the rules committee, said at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Voting Rights Act in the background, the fight over HB 589 became a referendum on the past, and whether the new rules were—as the plaintiffs charged—a revival of Jim Crow rules like literacy tests, intended to weed out black voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is our Selma,” said the Reverend William Barber II, the head of the state NAACP and an organizer of “Moral Mondays,” a series of huge demonstrations in Raleigh and elsewhere that have gone on since Republicans took control of the state and began passing a series of very conservative reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defendants disagreed. “The history of North Carolina is not on trial here,” a lawyer for Governor Pat McCrory said at the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Schroeder sided with the defendants. “There is significant, shameful past discrimination. In North Carolina's recent history, however, certainly for the last quarter century, there is little official discrimination to consider,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the central story in the Old North State’s political battle—the state has become hyperpolarized in the years since Republicans won control of the General Assembly in 2010 and the governorship in 2012—the voting-rights story has been pushed to the side more recently by the even-hotter controversy over HB2, the recently enacted law that bans transgender bathroom accommodation in state facilities and preempts city rules on transgender accommodations, LGBT non-discrimination, and living wages. In the hours before Schroeder’s ruling was revealed on Monday, Moral Monday protestors were demonstrating in the streets of Raleigh against HB2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Takei was adamant that, even though he had felt the Bern during the campaign, it was important to ultimately coalesce around Clinton. \"Having been through many bruising primaries in my life, I'm also a realist,\" said a stern Takei. \"From where I sit, the math is clear. Hillary likely will win and she will be our nominee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The former Star Trek star-turned-millennial-icon said that even though Sanders would likely not receive the nomination, he had already won a victory — of sorts — by energizing the Democratic electorate during what he called a \"historic\" nomination fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked for a pledge — no, not the Donald Trump kind of pledge — from supporters to \"vote blue, no matter who.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "... and yes, it came with its own hashtag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takei said Clinton and Sanders supporters were members of the same family and that families \"come together when threatened.\" He then listed a litany of issues which the two agree on, including, expanding the Affordable Care Act, protecting abortion rights and raising the minimum wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bernie himself has said that, 'On her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day.'\" Takei noted. \"If Bernie believes that, his supporters can too.\"\n",

      "Planet Nine Might be Responsible for Mass Extinctions\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Planet Nine has seen its share of headlines lately, but its newfound popularity is also bringing back theories that the yet-to-be-discovered planet may have affected, and may in the future affect, life here on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retired astrophysicist and current University of Arkansas math professor Dr. Daniel Whitmire says Planet Nine’s suspected multi-million year orbit around the sun may trigger comet bombardments. His analysis suggests this happens about once every 27 million years.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does this happen? Planet Nine passes through the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond the outermost planets that is the breeding ground for comets and asteroids alike. As the planet passes through this region, it disrupts the paths being followed by comets, sending some of them hurtling toward the inner solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmire’s research found that some of these comets not only would end up striking Earth, but that they would also disintegrate in large numbers, effectively lowering the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth. Furthermore, Whitmire was able to match the theorized interval of Planet Nine’s orbit through the Kuiper Belt to mass extinction events here on Earth, lending credence to paleontologist theories that the death of the dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures may indeed have been the result of comet impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is not a perfect one-to-one correlation,” Whitmire told Digital Trends in an interview Friday. He attributed the events that did not correlate to statistical randomness. “Nonetheless the statistical analysis shows a strong regular period of 27 million years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmire already showed back in 1985 — when he first started looking into the possibility of Planet Nine-related comet barrages — that the pattern held for at least the last 250 million years. Newer research suggests that these barrages may actually have been happening for as much as 500 million years, and quite possibly longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest comet shower is thought to have occurred around 11 or so million years ago, around the time of the Middle Miocene mass extinction. Before that, similar events were thought to have occurred around 38 and 66 million years ago, the latter thought to be the comets that killed off the dinosaurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t ring the alarm bells though for the next bombardment. Humankind will likely be dramatically evolved (if hopefully not long gone) by the time Planet Nine passes through the Kuiper Belt again. “Modern man doesn’t have worry about the next comet shower for 16 million years,” Whitman quipped.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rush, according to the Dallas Observer, was born female and identifies as a woman. She wore a T-shirt, basketball shorts and sported a blonde fauxhawk when the man mistook her for a man.\n",

      "Update: Well this just became even more of a s**tshow. Sarah Palin is suing Azealia Banks, according to People.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think this time I don’t just sit back and swallow it, but put the fear of God in her by holding her accountable,” she told People. “As many of you have for years implored me to do, I’m finally going to sue.”\n",

      "“I’ve had enough of the unanswered threats and attacks against my family and me,” Palin continued in a statement. “So, for the first time I’m going to enjoy the only retribution some protected ‘celebrities’ seem to understand – I’m suing Azealia Banks and can’t wait to share my winnings with others who have gone defenseless against lies and dangerous attacks far too long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her statement continues to note that it’s so unfair how “if a white girl were to say what this black girl is saying, the screams for the entire white population’s head would be louder than the nonsensical rap that Azealia spews all the way to the bank.”\n",

      "What happened was that the Slay-Z artist read a hoax article on an Onion-wannabee satire site that falsely claimed that Palin had said “slavery wasn’t forced onto African-Americans, they accepted it willingly.” Now, the one-time vice presidential candidate has said some pretty reprehensible things, but this quote wasn’t one of them. Nevertheless, a misguided Banks fired back in a series of now-deleted tweets. (Screenshots via Paper).\n",

      "On Tuesday, Palin finally responded to Banks’ offensive tweets. In a Facebook post, Palin addressed the 24-year-old artist only as “Female Rapper,” and went on to implore Banks to use her “influential platform” so they can “work together on something worthwhile – like condemning racism, along with empowering young women to defend themselves against a most misogynist, degrading, devastating assault perpetrated by evil men – rape.”\n",
      "\n",

      "4 Mysteries From Ancient Egypt We Still Can't Figure Out\n",
      "The Ancient Egyptians ruled a significant chunk of the world for almost 3,000 years, and left behind a rich legacy of art, architecture and mythology. But Ancient Egypt also left behind a few mysteries that archeologists and scholars still haven't been able to solve, even thousands of years later. Here are some of the enduring mysteries of Ancient Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What did ancient Egyptians look like?\n",
      "\n",
      "AP White actress Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the mummies, statues and engravings that the ancient Egyptians left behind, there is still much controversy over just what, exactly, they looked like. One thing's for certain though — despite what you might believe about them given Hollywood's whitewashing of Egyptians, the residents of ancient Egypt weren't white.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Slate, they were probably a range of colors, and \"neither white nor black\" by our contemporary understandings: \"Ancient Egypt was a racially diverse place, because the Nile River drew people from all over the region. Egyptian writings do not suggest that the people of that era had a preoccupation with skin color. Those who obeyed the king, spoke the language, and worshipped the proper gods were considered Egyptian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How were the pyramids built?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancient Egypt's massive pyramids are another element of their legacy that has long puzzled the experts. Just how, exactly, did a society with no modern construction equipment manage to transport the giant, heavy stones needed to build the enormous pyramids? According to recent research by physicists at the University of Amsterdam, part of the answer may be wet sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It turns out that wetting Egyptian desert sand can reduce the friction by quite a bit, which implies you need only half of the people to pull a sledge on wet sand, compared to dry sand,\" study lead author Daniel Bonn told LiveScience. An ancient wall painting also seems to depict Egyptians wetting the sand as they pulled a sledge bearing a giant statue, offering more evidence that water may have been part of the arduous and complicated process of building the ancient pyramids.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. How did King Tut die?\n",
      "\n",
      "The young King Tutankhamun has fascinated historians since his tomb was discovered in 1922, but the specifics of his life — and death at the age of 19 — remain somewhat of a mystery. A longstanding theory that he died in a chariot crash was seemingly debunked when scans of his mummified body revealed that he had a \"partially clubbed foot\" that would have made it impossible for him to stand on his own, reported the Independent in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new research also revealed, through genetic analysis, that Tutankhamun's parents were likely brother and sister, and he may have died \"as a result of genetic impairments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. What's hidden inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Khufu pyramid, the largest of the three pyramids at Giza, may actually contain some hidden secrets. A 2015 thermal scan of the Great Pyramid indicated that there were \"thermal anomalies\" within the structure, reports the Guardian, though it's unclear what, exactly, that might mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "A statement released about the results of the scans said the anomalies could mean many things: \"To explain such anomalies a lot of hypothesis and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents,\" reported the Guardian. There could even be an as-yet-undiscovered hidden tomb, but the project, which is expected to last through the end of 2016, hasn't drawn any conclusions yet.\n",
      "Oklahoma Republican Apologizes for Saying Native Americans Are Predisposed to Alcoholism\n",
      "Oklahoma state Rep. Todd Russ, a Republican, stepped in a steaming pile of controversy last week when he claimed that Native Americans are \"predisposed to alcoholism\" and would be disproportionately impacted by laws expanding liquor sales in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The representative's suggestion that Native Americans \"process alcohol differently\" came during a debate on the House floor about a proposed change to the state constitution that would allow wine and full-strength beer to be sold in convenience stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russ apologized for his comments in an email to Indian Country Today Media Network on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I apologize for the unintended pain I have caused Native Americans by my statement that was based upon outdated information,\" he wrote. \"I hope this misstatement has opened the dialogue that ensures the most accurate and current information is communicated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Garett Fisbeck/AP Oklahoma House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "An overwhelming body of research repudiates Russ' original claim. One study published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found no correlation between alcohol abuse among Native Americans and how their bodies process alcohol. Another from the New England Journal of Medicine drew a similar conclusion, finding that whites and Native Americans metabolize alcohol similarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the myth persists nonetheless. \"It's easier to pathologize people than it is to think critically,\" Jessica Elm, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington who studies Native American health, told the Verge in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true, however, that Native Americans are significantly more likely to die of alcohol-related causes — for instance, traffic deaths and liver disease — than other groups. But this isn't because they are genetically predisposed to alcoholism. Public health researchers have linked high alcohol abuse among Native Americans to a variety of factors, including high rates of depression — Native American youth have the highest suicide rates in the nation among those of the same age — and endemic poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But instead of treating this as a public health problem and seeking ways to address it, lawmakers like Russ pathologize Native American people themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help address this public health problem, policymakers must ensure Native American communities have the resources to treat substance abuse and underlying mental health issues. But even that may fall short of addressing the root of the problem, which stems from social forces that require systemic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a transcript of Russ' full apology:\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize for the unintended pain I have caused Native Americans by my statement that was based upon outdated information. I hope this misstatement has opened the dialogue that ensures the most accurate and current information is communicated. Opportunities to be more informed are welcomed as it gives me the knowledge to make the most educated decisions when I vote for legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Substance abuse has no preference of race, gender, ethnicity, religion or socioeconomic status. I have been personally affected by the misery caused from substance abuse by loved one's myself. As a young boy, I witnessed the sadness of alcoholism with my Grandfather whom I loved dearly. As a result of my own family's predisposition to alcoholism, I latter [sic] witnessed the direct and indirect effects of alcohol on four of my five siblings. Unfortunate choices that started with alcohol bombarded those I loved the most. I am sad to say that we have since buried two of my younger brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My life has been ripped and torn and broken from the dark nature of alcohol from my childhood. Because of my personal experiences, I am passionate about derailing efforts of the intoxicating liquor and wine industries to make alcohol even more readily available with fewer restrictions. In my concern for the unsuspecting public and other social groups, I let my emotions cloud my thoughts and words. I am very sorry and truly meant no hurt or harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was elected to represent a beautifully diverse district and I work diligently to ensure everyone is represented. I take and will continue to take opportunities to immerse myself in the diversity so that I build relationships that strengthen the people whom I serve.\n",

      "Italian Neurosurgeon To Attempt World's First Head Transplant\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a plan that Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been concocting for years, first introducing the notion to the public in 2013. The two-part procedure is composed of HEAVEN (head anastomosis venture) and Gemini (the subsequent spinal cord fusion), and was initially outlined in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Surgical Neurology International. Canavero presented at the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopaedic Surgeons’s 39th annual conference last year, where his speech about the ambitious procedure served as the keynote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole process involves 36 hours, 150 people (doctors, nurses, technicians, psychologists, and virtual reality engineers), and around $20 million. Valery Spiridonov, a 31-year-old Russian program manager suffering from the rare muscular atrophy disorder Werdnig-Hoffman disease, has already signed on to become the first patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how will it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Canavero, there will be two surgical teams working at the same time. One will focus on Spiridonov, the living patient, while the other will focus on a donor’s body. The donor will be brain-dead and selected based on height, build, and immunotype. Both patients will be anesthetized and hooked up to breathing machines and electrodes to keep tabs on brain and heart activity. Then, Spiridonov will have his head nearly frozen — temporarily brain-dead himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, attending physicians will drain the blood from his brain, and flush it with a surgery solution. Tubes will be looped around major arteries and veins to stop blood flow, and then later removed to allow for circulation once the new body is attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the most important part of all — cutting both spinal cords. This will be done with a $200,000 diamond nanoblade, which comes from the University of Texas. Once Spiridonov’s head is no longer attached to his body, he’ll have to have a new body within one hour. All the necessary arteries and veins will be reconnected, and theoretically, the new blood flow will re-warm Spiridonov’s head. From there, the spinal cord segments will be fused in yet another novel procedure, and all severed muscles and skin will be sewn back together as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all goes according to plan, Spiridonov could be up and walking three to six months after surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, skeptics abound for the procedure, but the patient says that he’s willing to risk death to escape his current condition. “If he is going to die,” Canavero says, “he is the only one who can decide.” The procedure is currently slated to take place late next year.\n",

      "Interestingly enough, this new tech doesn’t even involve actually touching the display. We’ve see this before with Samsung’s Air View, but it appears Microsoft is investing a little more attention to the details. It’s not about navigating your phone without ever touching the display. It’s more about making things more efficient when you actually do touch it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of this tech is a self-capacitive touchscreen that detects your fingers as they approach the display. Past renditions of this type of tech used either the front-facing camera or ultrasound, but Microsoft’s version uses the display itself. The advantage to this is that multitouch can take place above the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It uses what Microsoft refers to as anticipatory techniques to detect the grip and the approach of the fingers to adapt the interface. For example, if you’re watching a video, the control options will show up on the display as your finger(s) approach the screen. You can then tap the pause button with one touch. Normally you would have to tap the screen with one finger in order to get the controls to appear, and tap it again to pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft takes this a step further by modifying how the controls appear based on how you’re holding the device. If you happen to be holding your phone with one hand and attempting to control it with the same hand, the controls on the display will appear in a different spot to make it easier. It can also adapt to whether it’s your right or left hand that you’re using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s 3D Touch differs in that the display on the iPhone 6S or 6S Plus detects how hard you’re pressing. A light touch might offer a preview of a particular email, while a harder touch would actually open the email in full view. Microsoft’s pre-touch display senses your movements, and even how your holding the device, to provide the appropriate options before you place your finger(s) on the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video above also demonstrates how the Web browsing experience can be enhanced. Hyperlinks will only appear if you approach the display with one finger, but navigation controls will appear if there are multiple fingers. The display also detects a touch with a rapid move as a flick, but a touch involving a slower motion could be used for highlighting text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft was rumored to be working on something similar to 3D Touch for a Windows Phone called the McClaren. Supposedly that phone was scrapped, and it’s possible that the Redmond company shifted its efforts to providing this pre-touch feature. The video above most likely depicts a prototype phone for testing, not necessarily an actual upcoming model.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won’t be surprised if Microsoft uses pre-touch tech on both smartphones and Surface tablets, but unfortunately we have no idea when. It’s also possible that it never comes to market, but it looks too cool to put on the back burner.\n"

      "I did this research in the late spring of 2008. I spent two months in Covington interviewing people. On Jimmy Wade’s death certificate [PDF], the cause of death was “shot” and “due to: shot dead when I saw him.” On the second page [PDF], the undertaker from Bryant Funeral Home (one of two black funeral homes at the time) declares: “Homicide 6-29-47.” The county coroner at the time, Doc Ellison, was still alive in 2008. He confirmed that JWSr. was shot at least 20 times, but he would not discuss the death.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lynching occurred around 9pm after Jimmy Wade and his son, Jimmy Jr,. watched Sunday afternoon baseball and then went to the pharmacy on the square to get an ice cream. They were sitting on a bench on the side of their house across the street from the church listening to vespers, since it was hot and the windows were open. JWSr. liked to sit outside and listen rather than go in the church, while his wife and daughter were inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 9pm, a black sedan with four men inside pulled up alongside the father and son. Sheriff Jim T. Scott got out of the car and told JWSr. to get in. The other white men in the car were Mr. Strickland (the owner of Strickland Grocery who accused JWSr. of attempting to rape his wife), my grandfather Joe Oscar Hill, and another man, unknown. They took JWSr. to a field behind the Strickland home where they castrated him, dragged him behind the sedan by a rope, and shot him 20 times.\n",

      "In addition to the death certificate and article, I am also including a transcription of a conversation I had with Jimmy Wade Jr. in 2008 [PDF]. He lives in Detroit. JWJr. told me that 6/29—the day of JWSr.’s death—was his sister Margaret’s birthday and she never celebrated her birthday again.\n",

      "Both forearms were broken in defensive wounds. The back of his head crushed. Shot through the wallet in his breast pocket into his heart. The pocket had powder burns and pieces of the wallet were found in his heart. They cut him down where his private clothes.\n",

      "This lynching terrifies the black community even to this day. People remember it and don’t feel safe. Hattye Yarbrough, JWJr.’s elementary teacher at the Fraser School, described how she felt:\n",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.\n",

      "How Wave Energy Could Power Homes, Thanks to This Wavestar Sustainable Energy Machine\n",
      "Harnessing the the ocean to produce usable power is the mission of alternative energy company Wavestar. The Denmark company has been working on its \"big ocean\" commercial 1 megawatt machine for a 2017 release, according to its website. The machine seeks to tap into the frontier of the renewable and limitless energy of wave power. The rise in development and adoption of wave power often draws comparisons to that of wind power, according to Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could say that in the long run it's necessary that we go from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy — it's what we have to do to help protect the environment, look after our earth and it would be good for all mankind,\" Wavestar co-founder Niels Hansen said in a video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using its 20 floaters, which bounce with the movement of waves, the 1 megawatt machine would transfer kinetic wave energy through hydraulics to turn and power a generator, according to Tidal Energy Today. One day, the goal is to increase the output of each machine to 6 megawatts, enough for one machine to power up to 4,000 homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of tidal power can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when people used the moon's power to help grind grain, according to GE Reports. One of the benefits of tidal power is the fact that it's cyclical and predictable, so people know how much power is coming and when. It's also more powerful than wind, since waves are 800 times denser than air, according to Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "To handle the higher density of water, Wavestar's machine would also be able to seamlessly adapt to weather and wave conditions, also lifting up its floaters when it's too stormy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While out sailing by theirs parents' beach house in 2000, Niels and Keld Hansen brainstormed the idea of harnessing wave energy, buying the rights to a machine in 2003, according to the Wavestar website. The first tank testing went underway in 2004 at Aalborg University. Since then, the company has been testing larger scales of the machine and new power take-off systems, according to Tidal Energy Today.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the university, other energy companies, such as Wave Dragon and Seawave Slot-cone Generator, have been testing out similar wave energy projects alongside Wavestar — all with the hopes of producing a commercialized wave energy machine.\n",

      "iPhone warning signs: Apple management is losing control of the situation\n",
      "Much more concerning for Apple is that the longer the remaining 60% of the installed base delays an iPhone upgrade, the longer the upgrade cycle is extending. It is not unreasonable for the iPhone installed base to extend out to four or even five years. Not surprisingly, these trends were never accurately captured in consumer survey research reports. This is unchartered territory for Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "iPhone Growth Catalysts Are Disappearing. While there are legitimate reasons for explaining some of the iPhone's recent sales declines, much more concerning is how the largest multi-year growth catalysts for the iPhone business are either disappearing or turning out to be much less attractive than first thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mobile carrier expansion is slowing. A significant contributor to iPhone sales growth over the years has been mobile carrier expansion. As Apple brought the iPhone to new mobile carriers, the device's addressable market continued to expand. In early 2014, China Mobile began selling the iPhone for the first time, opening up the iPhone to hundreds of millions of new consumers of which tens of millions were in a position to buy an iPhone right out of the gate. There are no additional carriers like China Mobile waiting in the wings where Apple can expand the iPhone's addressable market. Most of the world's population is now on a mobile carrier that sells iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. India is not the next China. India has recently been positioned as the next big growth engine for iPhone. However, it is becoming clear that this optimism has been grossly misplaced. Cook even admitted on Apple's 2Q16 earnings call that India's smartphone market is where China was seven to ten years ago. That comment is not too reassuring for anyone thinking India would pick up the sales slack from a slowing China market. The country is just not in a position to represent a significant driver for iPhone unit sales given Apple's current pricing strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. High smartphone saturation rates. High smartphone saturation rates in the U.S. and other developed countries have removed feature phone users as an iPhone growth catalyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Declining number of premium Android switchers. Apple has been very successful over the past year and a half appealing to high-end Android switchers craving larger iPhones. However, there are signs that the easy growth in terms of Android switchers is ending. There are only so many premium Android users in the marketplace, and Apple will need to begin appealing to Android users in lower price brackets to achieve the same kind of user growth. During 2015, there were approximately 1.2 billion people that bought a non-iPhone smartphone, up from a little more than 1 billion in 2014. Of that total, approximately 100 million were likely in a position to even buy a flagship iPhone. This does not exactly leave much room for Apple to grow the number of Android switchers year after year.\n",

      "New Racist Texts Show San Francisco Officers Joking About \"Slave Ships\" And Ferguson\n",
      "San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr announced Friday that all officers on the city's force would undergo anti-harassment training after he released a transcript of racist and homophobic text messages sent among officers about suspects and citizens in the city. The latest batch of offensive exchanges comes days after authorities confirmed the authenticity of an older series of messages released by a city attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can only hope the anti-harassment class will discourage police officers from referring to the citizens they are sworn to protect and serve as n****** and \"beaners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The newly released texts show the officers denigrating black and Latino suspects with racial slurs and insulting fellow officers whom they perceived to be gay. The texts also include conversations ridiculing the black community in Ferguson, Missouri, where police fatally shot an unarmed black man in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "One multimedia message includes a photo of smoke rising above San Francisco. Officers guessed the cause of the fire, the AP reported: \"Must be Korean BBQ,\" reads one text message. \"I heard was a slave ship!!\" another reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities investigating sexual-assault allegations against a former officer said they found the text messages on two officers' personal phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suhr detailed steps he's taking to combat bias in the department, which include making the force as diverse as San Francisco's population of more than 837,000. Ed Lee, the city's first Chinese-American mayor, emailed every officer in the force on Thursday urging him or her to report colleagues who exhibit biased or racist behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suhr, who has been embroiled in a scandal over an alleged culture of racial bias and brutality in the department since 2014, previously stated that the text messages aren't proof that racist attitudes are deeply rooted in the force of 2,100 officers. The scandal helped to flare tensions with the black community in December, when officers fatally shot Mario Woods, a 26-year-old African-American who was wielding a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mere existence of the texts left some officers feeling betrayed, as most on the force felt unfairly associated with the bias allegation, Suhr said. \"The vast majority of police officers are shaken,\" he said. \"The expectations [of professional conduct] have never been higher, so when officers do something like this, the disappointment can't be greater.\"\n"

      "A Community and Its Whale Hunts\n",
      "One of the longest-standing traditions in the Faroe Islands — massive, lush green mounts that jut out of the North Atlantic, between Norway and Iceland — is whale hunting. Many outsiders find the hunt appalling, the way the blood of the hunt reddens the sea, but Katie Currid feels differently. The American-born, Europe-residing photographer captured these images of the whale hunt in the summer of 2011, and describes it as “one of the most amazing things I’ve ever been a part of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What Currid saw in the hunt — and what we think these photos convey, in all their gory glory — was the coming together of a community in the aftermath of a hunt, to sort and share the meat and to help feed one another. To Currid, much of the outrage over the hunt is unwarranted. The pilot whales are not endangered, they spent their lives free in the ocean and they’re killed swiftly. We don’t generally put up the same fuss over large-scale beef factories, she points out. Ultimately, the whale hunt disturbs us, she argues, because people don’t “realize that the life of an animal is a byproduct of their dinner.”\n",

Perry's phone was broken when the boys' left, so they agreed to share use of Austin's phone while on the boat, Perry's mother argues, and because of that, the phone is half hers. She believes she will \"continue to suffer irreparable harm if the iPhone is not properly handled as material evidence in a possible maritime crime or homicide.\"\n",

That can't be maneuvered by the passage of time, the current, and other events,\" the Cohen's lawyer Guy Rubin told WPBF. \"If the storm came and capsized the boat, the battery switch and the key would not be in those positions.\" While it's possible the boys turned the battery off to conserve battery if they knew they were in trouble with the storm, it's also possible someone tampered with the boat before they left.\n",

      "\"Maybe the most logical explanation is the storm, but maybe they were abducted.

It's unclear if Wolverine will have a major role in Apocalypse, or if he's simply making a cameo similar to his appearance in X-Men: First Class.\n",

While Wolverine succeeded in his mission and returned to the present day, his unconscious body in the past was retrieved by a William Stryker-impersonating Mystique. As Mystique appears to be one of the leaders of the X-Men, we could see Wolverine appear as a feral trump card in the battle against Apocalypse. Jackman will make his alleged last appearance as Wolverine in the upcoming Wolverine 3, which is due out next year.\n",

      "A man is suing both 18-year-old Christal McGee and Snapchat after the teen allegedly hit him with her car while trying to reach an impressive number on the app's speed filter, according to the official complaint.

The road's speed limit is 55 miles per hour. McGee allegedly told the passengers in her car who were concerned about her speed (one of whom is pregnant) that she was \"just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat\" while filming in selfie mode with the speed filter on.\n",

The subjects in her series, she says, are not “ethnically” First Nation, but rather “Europeans who use cultural mirroring, as practiced heavily in the 1960s and ’70s, to claim Indianness.” Osborne says it’s also a means of declaring sympathy with Native Americans. According to the photographer, the hobby was once used as a form of psychological escape from Iron Curtain dictatorships. Because this “deeply private” subculture is still present today, says Osborne, “I wanted to explore whether imitation is flattery.”\n",

      "We Might Be Totally Wrong About the Universe's Expansion\n",
      "Researchers have obtained the most accurate measurement yet of how quickly the universe is expanding — and it's not what they were expecting to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "The universe is expanding about 8% faster than predicted, according to a new study published on the preprint server arXiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the results are confirmed, it could transform our understanding of dark matter and dark energy, and completely change our understanding of cosmology itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that there is something in the standard cosmological model that we don't understand,\" Adam Riess, co-discoverer of dark energy and lead author on the new paper, told Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cosmological mystery: Cosmologists believe dark matter is an invisible material that makes up 27% of the universe, while visible matter only makes up 5%. The fact that we can measure dark matter's gravitational pull suggests that it exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark energy makes up the other 68% of the universe. It's an unknown force that cosmologists think is accelerating the expansion of the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosmologists think dark matter puts the breaks on expansion, while dark energy accelerates it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of what we know about dark matter, dark energy and the universe's expansion is based on our observations of radiation left over from the Big Bang called the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, scientists put together the most detailed maps of the CMB we've ever had. Think of the maps as the baby pictures of our universe. Based on those baby pictures, scientists can predict how our universe expanded and evolved — and what its current rate of expansion should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem? The latest measurements in this study don't match those predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA Image of the cosmic microwave background\n",
      "\n",
      "Reiss and his team measured the expansion of the universe by studying certain types of celestial objects, like stars and supernovae, known as \"standard candles.\" Standard candles are thought to all be the same level of brightness, so astronomers can use them as distance markers to measure how fast the universe is expanding away from us. If this new measurement is accurate — and our maps of the CMB are also accurate — then something about our fundamental understanding of the universe is wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers have possible explanations. Dark matter might have some property that we don't know about that's driving expansion. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy is that dark energy has simply gotten stronger over time, and sped up the universe's expansion rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, it might be that our way of measuring expansion isn't very accurate. Cosmologists rely on standard candles to tell them how quickly objects are moving away from us, but there's a growing body of evidence that these candles might not be so standard after all, and therefore not an accurate measurement of the rate of expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll have to wait and see if the new study holds up. If it does, cosmology as we know it may need a big overhaul.\n",

      "Ahhh college ... the keggers, late nights at the library, dining hall food and, um, paralyzing tuition payments? The average cost of a four-year college education in the U.S. varies depending on the type of school, but no matter where you go, it will probably cost you a pretty penny: The College Board puts the yearly average tuition at a four-year public college at $9,139 for in-state students and $22,958 for out-of-state students, while average yearly tuition at a private college is $31,231.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter what type of school you attend, the costs can add up quickly. According to the College Board's estimates, even if tuition rates didn't go up during your four years of school, a degree can cost you anywhere between $36,556 and $124,924.\n",
      "\n",
      "And remember, tuition and fees don't necessarily include additional costs like housing, meals and books, so real costs may be even higher. In 2015, Forbes reported that the average cost of college was more than $28,000 a year at a four-year public college and more than $59,000 at a private college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps due to the current, costly state of higher education, more college graduates than ever are leaving school with debt. According to the Wall Street Journal, the class of 2015 was the most indebted in history, leaving school with an average of $35,000 in student loan debt, and, in the U.S. today, \"Almost 71% of bachelor's degree recipients will graduate with a student loan, compared with less than half two decades ago and about 64% 10 years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scariest thing about tuition costs in the U.S. might not be how much they are now — but how much they're going to be in a few years. According to Forbes, \"the projected cost of an elite college from 2018 — 2021 could soar as high as $334,000 for a four-year degree.\"\n",

      "Get the five stories that will challenge you to rethink the world by signing up for MicCheck Daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texas dad Steve Rudner's Facebook post about his daughter is going viral — for all the right reasons. On Thursday, Rudner, a lawyer in Dallas, posted about his fears for his 21-year-old daughter. \"I worry about her being sexually assaulted, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of a drunk driver, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of gun violence, because lots of people die from gun-related injuries,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing Rudner isn't worried about? His daughter sharing a bathroom with trans women: \"Here's what I do not worry about: I don't worry about her being attacked in a restroom by a trans woman because (a) it has never happened; and (b) trans women are the most victimized group of people I've ever met, and the least likely to commit a crime of indecency in a restroom, because they are afraid of getting beat up when all they want to do is pee.\" Preach, man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner's Facebook post is a clear response to the so-called \"religious freedom bills\" proposed in several states and passed in North Carolina and Mississippi that either publicly or privately limit trans people from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities. Supporters of the legislation have argued that such measures are necessary to protect children, but, as Rudner points out in his epic Facebook post, children being in danger because they share a bathroom with a trans person just isn't a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, such laws would only make things harder for trans people, who already experience a disproportionate amount of violence. Rudner's post is clearly speaking to many who agree with him: It's been shared more than a thousand times and was reposted on a Facebook page called \"Living Blue in Texas.\"\n"

      "Every single person on the internet seems to have a thoroughly fleshed out theory on who died in the closing moments of The Walking Dead's season six finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Glenn, to Abraham, to Daryl, to Rosita - there's \"hard evidence\" to support every single theory. From now on, we're going to flesh out each one of those theories each day and let you decide which is most concrete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we'll start with Glenn Rhee. Glenn being the victim of Negan's kill is probably the most popular theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason for Glenn being the popular theory is Negan's arrival in The Walking Dead comics. When he showed up, he offered a long monologue just like he did on the show (plus a whole lot of swearing) and concluded with the most vicious game of eenie-meenie-minie-moe imaginable. Ultimately, \"it\" was Glenn. Negan proceeded to bash Glenn's skull as everyone looked on in horror and he struggled to call out for his wife, \"Maggie.\" However, The Walking Dead tends to swap deaths when adapting them to TV. For example, in the comics Tyreese got his head cut off while it waS Hershel on television and Abraham was killed by Dwight's arrow on the pages but it was Denise on TV. So, we're going to need more proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a story telling standpoint, Glenn makes the most sense. Losing the core character who found Rick and introduced him to this group in the first place would have a huge impact on Alexandria's perspective of Negan. He comes in and takes out a friend, a husband, and a soon-to-be father? Few other characters could spark more hatred for Negan as his victim. Then, there's the audio some folks have analyzed. If the subtitles are indeed accurate, then Glenn is a sure-thing goner. Have a look and listen:\n",
      "\n",

Then, there's the fact that we saw the beating from the victim's perspective. Throughout the episode, we saw the perspective of a certain character from inside the van where Michonne, Rosita, Michonne, and Glenn were being held hostage. Rosita's death would have little impact on Alexandria. Rick would have interjected before allowing Michonne to be slaughtered. Daryl was too weakened by his gunshot to withstand a blow to his head and get back up.

      "Earlier this week, the men and women aboard the USS Cook, a guided-missile destroyer operating on a training mission with Poland in the Baltic Sea, got a bit of an airshow: Two Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft buzzed their ship repeatedly, and then a Russian helicopter came sniffing around, too. CNN has good video of the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "It might seem like a simple case of a territorial pissing match. But let's not forget that the Russians have a long history of Maskirovka, or military deception, so it could be argued that one can never tell with them. Indeed, during the Cold War, there was an entire sub-industry in the West's intelligence community known as Sovietology, devoted to deciphering what the Soviets meant in each of their statements and actions. Nowadays it is a resurgent field, albeit under another name: Kremlinology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kremlinologists must be bored as of late, because the Russians have been quite transparent in their actions. In this case, it seems they were doing the military equivalent of a 5-year-old screaming, \"Look at ME, Look at ME!,\" mixed with a dose of \"Oh shit, we are surrounded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be made clear that this whole \"buzzing\" incident was essentially harmless. At almost any instant the USS Cook could have blown the planes from the sky—not just close in, but more than 100 miles out—without so much as a hiccup. All parties involved knew that. All parties also knew that Russia's actions were for media attention and provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was also because of their paranoia. To understand that, look at where these aircraft probably came from: Kaliningrad, formerly known as Konigsberg until the Soviets took over after World War II. Poland and Lithuania border it, and the city (and surrounding territory) is a \"Russian exclave,\" the equivalent of if we tucked Long Island somewhere inside of China's borders. This is one of Russia's only ports that can operate year-round. It is not attached to Mother Russia at all. Check a map.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you are both paranoid and want to show that your nation matters, what do you do? Duh, you buzz a U.S. ship working with your ancestral enemies in the region, the Poles. You show that rascally Poles, Lithuanians, and especially Americans cannot push you around. You show them who is STRONG, and when they see that, they will PAY. Show, indeed.\n",

      "The masters of the universe running Apple (aapl) have just discovered that the Celestial Kingdom is slipping out of their grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s recent decision to ban Apple from offering its iTunes Movies and iBooks Store services must have come as a shock to executives at the world’s most valuable company. As Apple’s second-largest market for iPhones, China is critical to the Cupertino-based company’s future. Total revenue from the Greater China region (which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) now accounts for about a quarter of Apple’s sales. And Apple has invested heavily in cultivating good relations with the Chinese government. CEO Tim Cook has visited China at least seven times since assuming his position in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does not seem to value such demonstrations of goodwill. The CCP seldom allows sentimentality to get in the way when a foreign company – even an old “friend of China” such as Apple—does something that arouses the party’s paranoia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this particular case, the digital books and movies offered by Apple are considered a potential threat to the Chinese government’s ongoing campaign of keeping out Western liberal ideas. In addition, the notion that Apple could dominate China’s digital content market must also have offended Beijing’s protectionist instincts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s unpleasant experience offers a warning to American tech giants eager to break into China. Facebook and Twitter, for instance, are currently blocked inside China, but both hope to get a piece of China’s vast Internet market in the future. What tech leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Cook need to learn is that no matter how hard they may try to convince Chinese leaders of their innocent intentions and the potential benefits of a partnership, they are unlikely to get anywhere. On a fundamental level, Beijing wants to keep foreign firms from dominating China’s information sector and from posing an existential threat to the CCP’s monopoly of power. China may have to pay a high price for such resistance. They may have to use inferior technology, products, and services. But such costs are considered affordable to the regime because they are borne almost exclusively by ordinary Chinese people.\n",
      "\n",
      "American companies face a dilemma, as China’s market is simply too big to ignore. If they do not try to curry favor from Chinese authorities, their competitors will. And ceding China to a rival is simply unthinkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driven by such considerations, Western companies, including American giants in all sectors, have adopted two principal strategies so far. The first is to demonstrate their commercial value to Beijing. The other is to establish rapport with Chinese leaders and build good guanxi (relations). Based on China’s recent turn toward protectionism and xenophobia, it looks like Western firms need to adopt a new approach to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any strategy that relies on the good will of Chinese authorities is dicey because of the arbitrary nature of the Chinese regime. A Western company that’s an “old friend” today could be a reviled “foreign devil” tomorrow if Beijing does not like what it is doing in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western companies ought to pursue a self-help strategy instead. The best source of such help is Washington. The Chinese government has signed many trade and commercial agreements with the U.S. and is a member of the World Trade Organization. U.S. firms should not hesitate to pressure Washington to hold Beijing to its commitments. China may have grown too powerful for most countries in the world to handle alone, but the U.S. retains sufficient clout to make China pay a heavy price if it treats American firms unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western companies should also band together. China plays the classic game of “divide and conquer” in dealing with Western companies, wooing some while bullying others. Regrettably, Western companies have been unable to form a united front, making themselves vulnerable to Beijing’s capriciousness. Individually, no Western firm, however successful or big, is a match for China. But China cannot afford to alienate a group of Western companies whose technologies, products, and services it sorely needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first step Apple should take is not to send Tim Cook to Beijing to plead its case. Kowtowing seldom works. Instead, Cook should take the lead in organizing other American companies with high stakes in the Chinese market to push back against Beijing’s opaque and arbitrary use of regulatory authority. Contrary to conventional wisdom counseling against public defiance toward Beijing, Apple and other American firms need to know that only collective action will get the attention of the Chinese government.\n",

We did a year of touring [and] for him to jump off of that -- just an entire year would have messed up his knees.\"\n",

      "And he was never afraid to be innovative.\n",
      "\n",

      "Please, Stop Calling Us Millennials\n",
      "Imagine sitting in a meeting where everyone’s talking about what YOU think … the collective “you” being that tech-savvy but supposedly lazy and entitled lot born between 1980 and 2000. You know, the M-word: millennials. This happens a lot to London-based marketing consultant Jessica Riches, whose colleagues — be they from Generations X,Y or Z — are forever trying to figure out how best to penetrate her generation’s heart (and, naturally, wallets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their best move, it turns out, may be in dropping the label altogether. A recent report on generational identification by the Pew Research Center reveals that:\n",
      "\n",
      "A surprising 60 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds don’t consider themselves part of the “millennial generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just over 40 percent of 27- to 34-year-olds, in fact, believe they’re Gen Xers, and of the younger ones — aged 18 to 26 — less than half see themselves as millennials. Did I hear you whisper “pain in the ass”? Every young generation’s been accused of being contradictory, but many millennials genuinely don’t identify with the term, and for good reason. Just 58 percent of them have even heard the term, says Alec Tyson, a senior researcher at Pew. That alone accounts for a lot of the disconnect, but there’s another factor: Every generation spans a relatively wide swath of ages, so this could “stem from a bit of understandable confusion about where the line is,” Tyson adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well-educated and media-savvy groups were most likely to be familiar with “millennials,” Tyson says, but even those who knew what it meant weren’t loving it. When asked how well the label described them personally, only 30 percent said it described them well. According to Tyson, “not many” millennials see this as a very important part of how they describe or think of themselves. Riches and many others of “that” generation seem to agree. “It’s hard to say whether we should be happy with the term … that appears to include so many things, but at the same time describes nothing at all,” she says, noting the contradictions. They’re described as entitled, for example, yet face huge debts; they’re lazy but entrepreneurial; and they’re expected to determine political outcomes, while also being apathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some also point to the fact that 20 years of births are too much for one umbrella, especially in the digital age. “There is a HUGE difference between millennials … born in 1985 and those born in 1995,” says Lauren Seward, 22, in San Francisco. Others, of course, simply hate the negative connotation. When her Gen X peers use the “M” term, many do so in a derogatory way, says Carrie Searing, a Washington-based 33-year-old who adds: “I take offense to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials aren’t alone in generational-identification woes. Only 58 percent of Gen Xers see themselves as such, and a whopping 82 percent of the silent generation don’t appreciate the moniker. The M-word, by comparison, has been around only a short while and could catch on more widely as the generation ages, Tyson suggests. But the terms used to describe generations do matter, he adds, noting: “Who wants to be called ‘silent’?”\n",
      "Navy Starts Testing Drone Ships Known as ACTUV\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "The very first prototype is meant to demonstrate the potential of what will ultimately become a fleet of unmanned ships, known as Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessels (to be pronounced “active” for short). The 132 foot long vessel managed to log a top speed of 27 knots during its test in Portland, Oregon, and it’ll be ready for open seas this summer when it launches from the California coast. The drone ship’s official christening is fast approaching on April 7, and the Navy seems pretty excited by the prospects of “an unmanned vessel optimized to robustly track quiet diesel electric submarines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to tracking submarines, the ACTUV could prove useful in a number of additional operations.Everything from serving as a supplier to other ships, countering undersea mines, and aiding in the logistics of complex operations could be carried out with these unmanned vessels, especially given their ability to remain at sea for three months at a time without a human crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "In preliminary tests, the drone has successfully tracked a submarine from 1 kilometer away, which the Pentagon says is a major improvement in the technology. “Picking up the quiet hum of a battery-powered, diesel-electric submarine in busy coastal waters is like trying to identify the sound of a single car engine in the din of a major city,” said Rear Admiral Frank Drennan, commander of the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACTUV ships are also expected to help lower costs for the U.S. Navy, helping it save human capital and resources with this autonomous technology. It’s still unclear as to whether these water drones will be weaponized, but if you happen to see an unmanned vessel floating around the California coast this summer, don’t be alarmed. It’s just an ACTUV ship, waiting to do its duty.\n",

      "Every day all over the world, people cross borders in search of a better life. But you know things are truly bad back home when you need to seek refuge in Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), however, that’s precisely the game plan for desperate citizens in one country on the Horn of Africa:\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 125,530 people from Eritrea have to fled to Sudan — and the UNHCR says this number is likely to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are fleeing the iron rule of Eritrea’s President Isaias Afwerki and his thick catalog of human rights violations, including (but not limited to) forced and indefinite military conscription, arbitrary arrests and torture. In fact, the autocratic East African country leads the world in only two grim categories: media censorship and child labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no wonder why so many young Eritreans (most refugees are age 18 to 24) try their luck in neighboring Ethiopia, which currently hosts more than 131,660 Eritrean refugees. According to UNHCR, 40,000 arrived in 2015, almost twice as many as the year before. Ethiopia is politically stable and has close cultural and historical ties to Eritrea, so refugees are well treated. Many, however, go to Sudan, where they can cross to Libya and take the dangerous passage to Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no future for anyone in Eritrea,” says Khalid, a 17-year-old from Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, who reached the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa after a 20-hour journey at sea from Libya. His older brother managed to get asylum in Switzerland, so that’s where he hopes to go next. Crossing the Mediterranean is a gamble with one’s life, but even Eritreans who stay in Sudan are not guaranteed their safety. Refugees often fall victim to smuggling, trafficking and rape. Human Rights Watch has reported cases of refugees being forcibly deported from Sudan back to the brutal regime from which they were fleeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When faced with a refugee crisis, a common response from developed nations is to try to improve refugees’ living conditions in the country of origin through diplomatic threats, aid packages or both. Unfortunately, neither of these strategies is likely to succeed in Eritrea, says Nicole Hirt, associate researcher at the GIGA Institute of African Affairs in Hamburg, Germany. The EU recently gave a $326 million aid package directly to Afwerki’s coffers with the hope of curbing the refugee influx. But Hirt believes “this will definitely not help. Instead, it will just contribute to extend the militarization of society.” Meanwhile, the government is actually benefiting from the growing diaspora through remittances and a 2 percent “diaspora tax” enforced by Eritrean embassies to citizens living abroad. (The government of Eritrea did not reply to requests for comment.)\n",

      "Racial bias has always been a serious threat to the health of minority populations. Police brutality and the Flint Water Crisis exemplify how institutional racism becomes a matter of life and death as well as a danger to people of color's overall wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a recent study from the University of Virginia shows these racial biases may follow black people right into the doctor's office.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the university's press release, Kelly Hoffman, a psychology Ph.D. candidate, asked 222 white medical students and residents to evaluate two mock cases and treat two fictional patients — one white, one black — for each. Hoffman had the study's participants prescribe pain treatments based on how much pain they believed the patients experienced, and they ended up revealing a major prejudice.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Hoffman asked whether the UVA med students believed racist myths such as that black people age slower than whites, that their nerve endings are less sensitive than white and that their skin is thicker than white people's, half of them said yes to at least one of the myths. What's more, she found that the same people who endorsed these biological myths were more likely to report lower pain ratings for their black patient and therefore provide less accurate treatment for those patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Mic/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Hoffman said the most surprising part of the study's results is how deeply ingrained these racist beliefs are, even in those who don't otherwise hold racist views.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's so striking is that, today, these beliefs are not necessarily related to individual prejudice,\" said Hoffman. \"Many people who reject stereotyping and prejudice nonetheless believe in these biological differences. And these beliefs could be really harmful; this study suggests that they could be contributing to racial disparities.\"\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after photographer Tara Ruby released a series dedicated to working moms who breastfeed, one of the women's husband faced backlash at work. According to WNEM, a New Mexico firefighter may be put on unpaid leave because his wife was wearing his uniform while breastfeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesman for the Lac Cruces Fire Department told the station he could not comment on the matter, but that the city does not have a specific policy regarding breastfeeding. He also confirmed the fire department's \"policy on uniforms does not specifically mention spouses, nor is it clear whether or not spouses may wear uniforms,\" reports KUTV, so it's unclear what the actual issue with the photo is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruby told the Las Cruces Sun-News she's gotten an overwhelming amount of support for her series and she pointed out the inherent issue with punishing someone for this photo: \"They're not supporting the normalizing of breastfeeding … or supporting anyone coming in and breastfeeding in uniform. It just seems like it's a double standard. There's fireman costumes for Halloween — and that's OK? Or is it strictly because she was breastfeeding and that's the problem?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruby also told Cosmopolitan.com earlier this month she will continue posting pictures like these in order to fight said double-standard. \"You can work a full-time job and breastfeed and do both equally well. If this is supporting someone out there, then let's do it,\" she said.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that there’s any need for further proof of tech’s diversity crisis, but if you were looking for some, consider your search ended. According to the CEO of Intel, the primary opposition to the company’s latest diversity and inclusion efforts has come from within the organization. Apparently, maintaining a homogeneous status quo is the chief priority of some Intel employees, leading to “a bit of a backlash” and even threats directed at Intel’s leadership. So yeah, there’s a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the PUSHTech 2020 conference on Saturday with Reverend Jesse Jackson in San Francisco, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich admitted that not everyone at his tech firm has been excited about the recent efforts to increase the proportion of underrepresented minorities at the company and in the industry at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People worry that as a white man, you’re kind of under siege to a certain extent,” Krzanich said. “There’s been a bit of resistance. We’ve even had a few threats and things like that on some of our leadership team around our position on diversity and inclusion. We stand up there and just remind everybody it’s not an exclusive process. We’re not bringing in women or African-Americans or Hispanics in exclusion to other people. We’re actually just trying to bring them in and be a part of the whole environment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just over a year ago, Krzanich dedicated an impressive $300 million to diversity efforts, and since then, the company has seen a 30-percent increase in its minority workforce. In the last year, the executive pointed out that 43.3 percent of its new hires were either women or minorities, and the company is planning on releasing a diversity report that will include employee pay reflecting gender and race.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are going with the data and we are going public,” Krzanich said. “I almost hope there are gaps, not because I want people to be underpaid, but because it’s a problem I can fix. I’m an engineer, I like fixing problems.” Now, if only we could get all of Intel (and the tech industry) to help fix the problem, too.\n",

      "23 Reasons Why We Definitely Don't Need Any Gun Safety Reforms Ever\n",
      "A 2-year-old boy picked up a gun and shot and killed his mother from the backseat of a car in Milwaukee on Wednesday, the Guardian reported. According to the Washington Post, it's just one of nearly two dozen such incidents this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Jan. 1, the Post found, there have been an astonishing 23 incidents in which a toddler picked up a gun, fired it, and hit someone — in 18 cases, the victim was the toddler, though in five, it was a bystander. In one incident in March, the victim was a Florida gun rights activist, Jamie Gilt, who posted a meme saying \"my right to protect my child with my gun trumps your fear of my gun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sad that this is even a thing. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/01/toddlers-have-shot-at-least-23-people-this-year/ ...pic.twitter.com/OOlfMos8tx\n",
      "\n",
      "While toddler-involved shootings are perhaps the most egregious gun incidents, their older brothers and sisters are pulling their weight as well. At least 77 people aged 17 or younger have shot someone with a firearm this year as of April 26, according to pro-gun control group Everytown For Gun Safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Post, shootings involving toddlers are disproportionately located in gun-friendly states including Georgia, Florida, Missouri and Texas, as well as Michigan, which has a major gun problem in the metro Detroit region. This follows a well-established pattern of gun violence in which states with looser gun laws tend to have more gun-related injuries and deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such disasters result in hundreds of child fatalities and have made American children nine times more likely to die in gun accidents than children anywhere else in the developed world,\" wrote the Post's Nathan J. Robinson. \"They demonstrate fairly conclusively that guns cannot be both safe and ubiquitous; the inevitable consequence of widespread gun ownership is a never-ending series of tragedies involving children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet the prevailing attitude appears to be that even talk of basic responsible ownership is for wusses and Constitution-haters,\" he added. \"The NRA has waged all-out war against pediatricians and the CDC for recommending gun safety to parents, lobbying hard for laws to prohibit doctors from even discussing firearms risks with families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, there's absolutely no telling whether those 23 gun-toting toddlers were just watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants. Or guns don't kill toddlers, toddlers kill toddlers. The only thing that can stop a bad toddler with a gun is a good toddler with a gun. Etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rinse and repeat, because if the U.S. is good at one thing, it's justifying entirely preventable and extremely widespread death, maiming and heartbreak from firearms with folksy maxims about gun rights and liberty.\n"

      "Paul Ryan’s Definitely-Not-Presidential Middle East Trip\n",
      "Paul Ryan’s Definitely-Not-Presidential Middle East Trip\n",
      "\n",
      "As Republicans back home whip up whispers, rumors, and entreaties for House Speaker Paul Ryan to swoop into the 2016 presidential race and save the GOP from tearing itself apart at an increasingly-likely contested convention, the Wisconsin congressman is on his first trip abroad as his party’s highest-elected official. With an itinerary of Middle East stops in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, such a trip seems somewhat, well … presidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "With dimming chances for significant legislative achievements this year and a battle for the top of the Republican ticket looming ever larger, Ryan has been increasingly pushed to weigh in. On Tuesday, Ryan’s home state delivered a huge boost to the presidential prospects of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is increasingly seen by GOP leaders as the most viable alternative to Donald Trump’s candidacy. Cruz won Wisconsin’s primary election by double-digits, 48 percent to Trump’s 35 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan says his role is neither rescuer nor referee. Yet he’s using his first trip abroad to draw an explicit contrast with President Barack Obama’s “neglectful” foreign policy, particularly toward Middle East partners such as Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing has changed — he’s not running for president, he’s not seeking the nomination,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres told Foreign Policy on Wednesday. “Speaker Ryan is focused on restoring traditional alliances that have been neglected under this administration and putting forward a vision of what U.S. foreign policy should look like in the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Israel is a popular stop for politicians of both parties, Ryan’s choosing it for his first is an intentional dig at Obama, who has had an at times icy relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent interview with the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama expressed frustration with Netanyahu, as well as Mideast Arab partners such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Obama administration officials and anonymous Israeli officials recently traded barbs in the press about who-snubbed-whom over a White House meeting with Netanyahu. Shortly after, at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee meeting in Washington last month, Ryan announced the Middle East trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have international terrorism that is threatening the civilized world. It’s threatening us. They’re coming at Israel, but they’re ultimately coming for us,” Ryan said Monday in an interview with the Times of Israel. “So we are partners in this war on terror, radical Islamic terrorism. Israel is an indispensable ally in that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost seven years after Obama’s famed Cairo speech, Ryan also spoke of developing “a generational strategy about winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world.” He reiterated oft-repeated criticism that the Obama administration doesn’t have a strategy to defeat the Islamic State, “let alone how do we prevent the 5-year-old in Pakistan from becoming a radical.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, his call for “a coalition of governments in moderate nations” to not only defeat the Islamic State but prevent radicalization is largely indistinguishable from Obama’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "While intended to serve as a rebuke to Obama, Ryan’s trip and tone also inevitably contrast the House speaker with Trump, the still-Republican front-runner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan has criticized Trump for his rhetoric and expressed some frustration with the billionaire businessman working crosswise against the mainstream Republican agenda. “We have to be more than just an opposition party. We have to be a proposition party,” Ryan has said consistently. But he’s also said he’ll support Trump if he’s chosen as the nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Trump’s own AIPAC speech drew applause, the pro-Israel lobby’s leaders formally admonished his criticism of Obama. Trump’s sizable loss in Wisconsin follows several weeks of controversy, including widely criticized statements on other candidates’ wives and abortion as well as a demonstrated lack of substance on foreign policy, and concerted efforts from the “Never Trump” campaign of anti-Trump Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliot Cohen, a prominent GOP national security expert and former State and Defense Department official, said he’d “be delighted” if Ryan would throw his name in the race if Trump or another candidate isn’t able to reach the required 1,237 candidates before the July GOP convention in Cleveland. Cohen is one of the main architects of a letter in which more than 50 Republican foreign policy experts expressed their concerns about Trump as a commander in chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This guy is just completely unacceptable,” Cohen said of Trump in a recent interview. “Cruz’s predisposition seems to be more narrowly nationalistic, whereas [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio was more ideology. … Paul Ryan is really right in the middle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary in December, said Ryan “isn’t a viable option.” Graham is so adamantly opposed to a potential Trump nomination that he’s endorsed Cruz, whom he openly acknowledges is a last choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take Paul at his word: I don’t think that’ll work,” Graham told reporters Tuesday. “Paul’s a great guy, a great speaker, a great candidate for president — I just don’t see how you can bring somebody in who wasn’t in the original group who went through the process and expect anything other than a disaster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, Ryan will be front and center at the convention — at the least, presiding over it as its chairman.\n",

      "Ancient Stone Depicting First Female Egyptian Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut Discovered\n",
      "Ancient inscribed stone blocks containing information about Egypt's long-lost and first female pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut — who ruled from 1473 B.C. to 1458 B.C. — have been uncovered on Egypt's Elphantine Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than being just one of about two or three female pharaohs in Egypt's history, Queen Hatshepsut was also a builder, and the blocks are presumed to be from one of her buildings that was recently discovered. The building, which was found by the German Archaeological Institute, is believed to be a way station for the god Khnum, according to a Facebook statement by the Ministry of Antiquities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the pillars are representations of several versions of the god Khnum, as well as other gods, such as Imi-peref 'He-who-is-in-his-house,' Nebet-menit 'Lady-of-the-mooring-post' and Min-Amun of Nubia,\" the Ministry of Antiquities wrote. \"The building thus not only adds to our knowledge of the history of Queen Hatshepsut, but also to our understanding of the religious beliefs current on the Island of Elephantine during her reign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Queen Hatshepsut stepped into her reign at the age of 12 years old when she wed her half-brother Thutmose II. Thutmose II died at a young age, and Hatshepsut became a guide for Thutmose III before assuming the role herself, possibly because of political threats. To keep her legitimacy as a fit ruler and not just a \"great wife\" of the king, Hatshepsut had to reinvent herself as a man. (The blocks refer to Queen Hatshepsut as a woman, which indicates that they're probably from the beginning of her reign, as she was referred to as a male later on.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In her reign, she brought wealth through a successful trade expedition and grand building projects. After her death, Thutmose III erased almost all remnants of Hatshepsut, including her buildings and images. Scholars didn't learn of her existence until 1822.\n",
      "How the US should respond to Saudi threat\n",
      "While the White House is reportedly planning to veto the bill, if passed, it takes a certain kind of ally to threaten to dump U.S. assets if they are held responsible for something they may have had a hand in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Hiltzik, a columnist at the Los Angeles Times, suggests that the Saudi threat to dump assets, particularly Treasury bonds, is an empty one, given that the kingdom may not own anywhere near that amount of Treasurys in the first place, let alone other assets that would be easily sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. should not quake in its boots over Saudi threats. First, the Saudis, despite their recent success in re-taking control of the oil market, remain pressured by rising competition from U.S. energy producers.\n",

      "A new survey found that 41% of Latino voters say they are motivated to vote in the 2016 election just to \"stop Trump\" and fight his anti-immigrant/Latino rhetoric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political opinion research group Latino Decisions recently published a survey of 2,200 registered Latino voters about the 2016 presidential election. On a scale of 1 to 10, with \"1\" being the most anti-immigrant someone could be, 71% of respondents gave Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump a 1.\n",

      "It’s been almost seven years since Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift’s VMA speech in 2009 to declare that Beyonce, in fact, had the “best video of all time,” but the rapper can’t seem to let the topic go. In a new radio interview with Steve Harvey, Yeezy brought up Swift out of the blue, even after Harvey said he “really wasn’t” trying to talk about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not about Kanye West. It’s not about Taylor Swift,” West said. “There’s a lot of people in America that feel like they don’t have the platform to stand up and express their closet racism.

      "By Courtney Leiva | April 20, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "We’d all like to think our hairstylist is a magical genie who is perfectly capable of granting any sort of hair wish. But truthfully speaking, our go-to stylists are only human, and can’t transform your tresses with the flick of a magic wand. And yes, you may think you know the ins and outs of everything hair, but maintaining appropriate salon etiquette is key to ensuring a great appointment for both you and your stylist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is seeing eye to eye crucial, but it can also help you achieve those wondrous (and not to mention realistic) results every time you pop into the salon. So, if you are looking to brush up your salon etiquette, here’s five things you can stop saying altogether. Yes, that even includes asking for discounts.\n",

      "There’s probably nothing a colorist hates more than lying about previous dye jobs you may have had in the past. Whether you’ve done henna, a semi-permanent color or highlights, Shaun Surething, co-owner and lead stylist at New York–based Seagull Hair Salon, says there is definitely still existing color in your hair, making it extra important to be honest about your past color history.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lying about having no traces of color in your hair will result in unpredictable results in the salon,” says Surething. “Even the most well-trained colorists can sometimes not see an old gloss that will affect the outcome of your new color.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Even worse comes lying about using box color, which can really affect your color outcome, especially if you plan on going lighter. To avoid unwanted and awkward color overlap, be sure to tell your stylist about any box color products you may have used in the past, even if it was three years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't ever try to lie about using box dye or at-home color in hopes we won't find out when you want to go lighter,” says Tiffany Chiapparelli, lead educator for amika. “We are lifting your hair from any color you've had, so there is no point in lying about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Don’t Hold Back Either\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaints at the salon can be tricky, but there usually is a way to air your grievances without sounding like that nagging woman everyone dreads. Experts like Chiapparelli stress the importance of speaking up, especially if your results are not to your satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't be shy if there is an issue that you notice mid-appointment,” she says. “We want you to be happy—so please speak up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t Think Your Results Are Going to Look Like the Picture\n",
      "\n",
      "Visuals can be more than helpful when it comes to showing your stylist exactly what you are going for, but some experts warn against relying on celebrity hair photos, as they can create unrealistic expectations. Just because your favorite songstress went blond, doesn’t mean you’ll get the same dramatic bleached effect. \"If you bring in a photo of a hair color you want, keep in mind that photo might have been edited, and there may not be a way to create that color in real life,” states Jackie Ferrara, senior colorist at Pierre Michel Salon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the same concept also applies to haircuts, as different facial shapes and features can make any chop look different on anyone. “We all have different head shapes, face shapes, features, hair texture and even hair color,” says Nicole Contrastano, senior expert stylist from Pierre Michel Salon. “One haircut can take on a whole different look on someone else.”\n",

      "Don’t Show Up Late, and Demand to Be Out On Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to tick off your hairstylist is showing up late, which can seriously throw a wrench into his or her schedule. A stylist’s schedule can book fast throughout the day, and showing up extremely late can throw off his or her workflow, really affecting your results.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can't make miracles happen and rush to give you the best appointment when we don't have the allotted time,” adds Michelle Lee, co-owner and master designer of Salon Eva Michelle in Boston. “Stylists naturally want their clients to be happy with the service, but if we feel rushed and we can't make it the best, it's a double-edged sword.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t Be Resistant To Change\n",
      "\n",
      "Change is always synonymous with a new cut or color, so experts recommend keeping this in mind when booking appointments, especially for haircuts. According to stylist Amerah at Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa, clients should always remember that all haircuts require some sort of change, even if you are coming in for a trim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t say you want a haircut, but then proceed to say you don't want the hair to look shorter,”Amerah says. “Anytime you cut hair, it only gets shorter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Chiapperelli finds that you shouldn’t give your stylist mixed messages either, as backing out of changes you’ve agreed to makes the process more unnecessarily complicated than it should be. “Don't tell your hairstylist you are ready for a change and then decline every one of our suggestions—it sounds like what you really need is a margarita and a good therapy session,” she adds.\n",

      "Badass abolitionist Harriet Tubman is set to join Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, and everyone is cheering, right? Not so, said Samantha Bee on Monday night's episode of Full Frontal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Bee said, some Republicans are condemning the decision as disrespectful to the former president — and those are the tamest opposers. Reminder: Tubman isn't even replacing Jackson on the bill. She's just joining him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Bee is having none of this dissent. \"[Andrew Jackson] was not a founding father; he was a genocidal prick who forced the relocation of non-whites and fomented populist rebellion, kind of like a Donald Trump with better hair,\" she said, referring to Jackson's Native American removal policy (a.k.a. the Trail of Tears).\n",

      "Still, Tubman's appearance on the 20 is a landmark move for U.S. currency. \"Finally, a black woman making a white man move to the back,\" Bee said.\n",

      "Update, October 20, 2017: Yet another child has died after an unanchored IKEA dresser tipped over, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Jozef Dudek passed away in May after a MALM bureau fell on the 2-year-old in his California bedroom. He had just been put down for an afternoon nap.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Our hearts go out to the affected family, and we offer our sincere condolences during this most difficult time,\" said brand spokeswoman Mona Astra Liss in a statement, adding that IKEA encourages consumers to use the anchoring kits that come with its products\n",

Curren Collas of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Camden Ellis of Snohomish, Washington; and Ted McGee of Apple Valley, Minnesota, all died after unanchored MALM dressers fell on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The families plan to share the settlement equally, the attorneys said in a statement. IKEA will also donate $50,000 to three children's hospitals in memory of each boy and give $100,000 to the children's safety nonprofit Shane's Foundation.

      "\n",
      "IKEA stopped selling the most of its dressers and chests in June, after the products failed industry safety tests because they could fall over when unattached to a wall. The retailer also recalled a total of 29 million items sold in the U.S. over the past 14 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced another fatality connected to an IKEA MALM dresser. A 2-year-old boy from Woodbridge, Virginia, died in September 2011 after an unanchored chest tipped over and trapped him between the drawers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the seventh death linked to IKEA dressers, and the fourth associated with the MALM specifically. A GUTE four-drawer chest tipped over and killed a toddler in 1989, as did the RAKKE five-drawer chest in 2002 and the KURS three-drawer chest in 2007.\n",

      "Here's something you might not have known about the moon landing, courtesy of one man who lived it: Buzz Aldrin himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aldrin and fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong only spent about two and a half hours clambering around the lunar surface during their historic 1969 moon landing. During that time, they planted an American flag, collected about 50 pounds of moon rocks and soil, set up a seismometer to measure any lunar quakes, collected gas samples and set up a reflector so scientists could measure the precise distance from the Earth to the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong was also tasked with taking lots of pictures during the mission. That's why almost every NASA Apollo 11 photo you see of an astronaut on the moon actually shows Aldrin, and not Armstrong. (By the way, don't Google \"Apollo 11 images\" unless you're prepared to sort through pages of fake moon landing conspiracy websites.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The most famous one is this iconic picture of Aldrin below. If you look closely at Aldrin's helmet visor, you can see the reflection of Aldrin's shadow, Armstrong and the Eagle lander:\n",
      "\n",
      "Armstrong took the photo with a 70mm lunar surface camera while the two explored a region of the moon known as the \"Sea of Tranquility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At an event promoting his new book, No Dream Is Too High: Life Lessons From a Man Who Walked on the Moon, in Manhattan on April 4, Aldrin said many people assume this famous photo was posed because it manages to capture both moonwalkers and the lander. Sometimes they ask him if NASA specifically ordered this kind of shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aldrin said that wasn't the case at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't staged,\" Aldrin said. \"It was just a lucky shot.\"\n",

      "\"It wasn't staged,\" Aldrin said. \"It was just a lucky shot.\" Tweet\n",
      "\n",
      "Aldrin was simply walking across the lunar surface and Armstrong snapped a photo at just the right moment.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the screenshots, the student tries to explain that HB2 does not protect women, and is rather an attack on the transgender community. The UNC College Republicans Facebook account responds, noting that \"if you are a male, then you have no business in the women's room,\" and later adding, \"if a tranny like you goes into the women's restroom, then what about the rights of them?\"\n",

      "Colombia became the fourth Latin American country Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage, joining Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. According to Newsweek, same-sex couples had previously been allowed to form civil partnerships before Thursday's court decision granting them full marital rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "A ruling earlier this month cleared a path for marriage equality when a 6-3 vote killed a petition stating that marriage should be reserved for heterosexual couples, the Guardian reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fernando Vergara/AP Two women celebrate the constitutional court's decision earlier in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Thursday's decision may have been pre-empted, it's still comes after nearly five years of push and pull on the social issue. According to the Guardian, in 2011 the constitutional court recognized same-sex couples as families and called for congress to legalize same-sex marriage, stating that if legislators hadn't passed a law in two years time, same-sex couples could enter civil unions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2015 the courts allowed same-sex partners to adopt children, but still skirted the question of marriage, postponing debates surrounding its legalization eight times over the next several months.\n",

      "We are now witnessing Elon Musk’s slow-motion disruption of the global auto industry\n",
      "In 2007, Nokia was the biggest and most fashionable name in cell phones, with an unassailable lead in hand-held technology. Things had been so good for so long that company executives saw little chance for any competitive challenge–phones were a tough business, they said, and Nokia was reaping the harvest of decades of hard work that no one else could hope to match.\n",
      "\n",
      "That June, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. And seven years later, Nokia—worth a quarter of a trillion dollars at its apex—abjectly sold off its much-diminished phone division to Microsoft. The price was $7 billion, less than 3% of its former value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple hasn’t introduced as revolutionary a product since, to the relief of incumbent players in all kinds of sectors. But Elon Musk, whose acumen and showmanship get him frequently compared with Jobs, has worked eagerly to fill the void.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 31, his Tesla Motors unveiled its long-promised Model 3, a $35,000 electric car that will go 215 miles per charge. The market response suggests to some the potential as a category killer, not just in electric vehicles, but mainstream cars in general: in the week since, more than 325,000 Model 3s have been pre-ordered by people putting down $1,000 per reservation, the company said April 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even deep Tesla skeptics call this demand unprecedented. There simply may be no example of a new car attracting as much interest in more than a century of automative history. Veteran auto analyst Bertel Schmidt says the closest comparison would be the 1955 Citroen DS (below), which was pre-ordered by 12,000 motorists on launch day. Wall Street has responded by sending Tesla’s share price up by about 12% since the Model 3’s debut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citroen The 1955 DS got 12,000 pre-orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "So are we witnessing Nokia redux?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s natural to ask whether we are observing an iPhone moment, the release of a blockbuster product that reconfigures the commercial landscape and transforms society. And, if we are, whether Tesla’s rivals face possible Nokiafication–a savage commercial blow in the face of a missed technological advance. (With a blog post yesterday titled, “The Week that Electric Vehicles Went Mainstream,” Tesla seems to suggest the answer at least to the first question is yes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If traditional automakers fear obsolescence, they aren’t showing it. ”While we applaud and welcome any new competitors to market, BMW remains focused on delivering the most innovative, efficient and technologically advanced vehicles to our customers,” BMW spokeswoman Rebecca Kiehne told Quartz.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll react to the competition,” says Tim Grewe, General Motors’ lead manager for electrification. “But our master plan hasn’t changed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such resolve, typical of people you talk to at the major car companies these days, is perhaps a sign of strength, a byproduct of confidence in the new electrics now in the pipeline, and ultimately skepticism that Musk will get much beyond the fringes of the worldwide automotive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or it could be a sign of complacency, a Nokia-like assumption that the moat is simply too wide for any new rival to traverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I definitely think that the auto industry has been surprised by the success of the [Model 3] pre-orders,” says Sam Jaffe, an analyst with Cairn Energy Research. “But I doubt that they will do anything in reaction to it. The whole concept of pre-ordering is so foreign to the car industry that they will probably willfully ignore it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But if there is one area in which Musk is objectively behind, it’s the speed with which mid-priced electrics will come to market. GM’s Chevy Bolt, for example—also priced at about $35,000, with a range exceeding 200 miles on a charge—will be in showrooms by the end of this year, the company says; Tesla customers won’t get their hands on a Model 3 until the end of 2017 at the earliest, and possibly not until 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grewe says that GM’s plant in Orion, Michigan is “ready to go now. We have no hurdles. We are ready for high-volume production. You can go buy the Bolt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Left unsaid but implied was that Musk is not quite so prepared. The question is whether he can catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is plenty of room for Musk to fall flat on his face\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Posawatz, who was part of the GM management team that developed the company’s plug-in hybrid Volt, argues that the onus of Tesla’s thick order book is not on its major rivals, but on Tesla itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Posawatz, now a private consultant, points out that Musk has been late—seriously late—delivering all three current Tesla models. When he finally delivered the Model X crossover in September 2015, it was three and a half years after the promised date.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, some Teslas produced to date have had quality issues. In October, Consumer Reports removed the Model S from its recommended list because of complaints including “squeaks, rattles and leaks,” not to mention problematic motors and brakes. Tesla largely repaired these flaws for free, and the company’s image hasn’t noticeably suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla That’s one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s challenge with the Model 3 isn’t just that he has ground to make up in terms of reliability, but that he again is starting from scratch: The Model 3 is derivative of no prior model; Musk must create entirely new assembly lines for the car in Tesla’s Fremont, California, factory (pictured above). The Model 3 battery, too, will be new. The place where it will be made–Musk’s vaunted Gigafactory, the gigantic lithium-ion battery plant he is building outside Reno, Nevada–“has yet to make a single cell,” Posawatz says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it’s not as though Tesla’s rivals are standing still. In addition to GM’s Chevy Bolt, Nissan will produce a second-generation Leaf with the same 200-mile range and approximately $35,000 price; it will come in 2017. Before that, Toyota will deliver its Prius Prime, a plug-in hybrid; and BMW already has its pure electric i3. The other major carmakers are piling in as well by the end of the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hoopla in response to these vehicles may never approach that generated by the Model 3. But every time another electric shows up on the scene, Musk risks losing customers to the incumbents—and has less wiggle room to miss his own delivery deadlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is the kind of trouble that you want\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has his challenge laid out for him—really tough, no question about it. But, if you’re in the car business, or any business really, this is the sort of problem that you want, versus one of lackluster demand, which is what has plagued rivals since electrics came onto the market six years ago. In terms of whether Musk is up to it, remember, this is the man who over the last decade has single-handedly validated both electric cars and private commercial space travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "AP/Ringo H.W. Chiu A problem all of us should have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing experts might argue—with good reason—that making 325,000 identically reliable, $35,000 automobiles on deadline is harder than putting a commercial rocket into space and bringing it home. But it is not as though Musk has spent the last decade in an ivory tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you forget about 2017—which arguably was never a realistic deadline—and instead look to 2019, Musk has three years to make good on the Model 3’s promise. If he delivers, both literally and figuratively, then he will create the transformational moment he has sought, both for Tesla and the industry as a whole. In other words, he does have a chance to catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Musk has already said that he is recontemplating his production plans. To fund the necessary manufacturing buildout, he is also probably talking with advisers about raising a lot of new capital. Barclays’ Brian Johnson reckons that Musk will sell $3 billion in new shares, and that seems a reasonable estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what we seem likely to be watching now is Tesla in a cool, cash-raising frenzy, and an incumbent industry on a risky precipice. In the middle of it all is Musk, aiming not necessarily for a Nokia moment for his rivals—though that could happen, he actually wants them to succeed—but most certainly aiming for an iPhone moment for himself.\n"

      "Once again, we discover that The Washington Post is covering a world with which the rest of us are unfamiliar, and that there are members of the current administration who are more than willing to set up housekeeping there. The Post reported on Saturday that the president is considering visiting Hiroshima, where he would deliver an address on nuclear non-proliferation. This seems like a fine place to deliver such an address, but what do I know? There are, of course, domestic political problems with the idea, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House is well aware of the potential for domestic criticism around a Hiroshima trip, especially in an election year. Republicans have consistently portrayed Obama's foreign policy as feckless and weak, and the president was ridiculed in 2009 when he bowed to the Japanese emperor in Tokyo. During the 2012 presidential campaign, GOP nominee Mitt Romney accused Obama of undertaking a global \"apology tour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, so here we see the problem—and it's not that the Post is treating what Republicans said as fact simply because Republicans said it. Per the Post's own link, the \"bowing\" episode bothered both Laura Bush's old flack and someone called Political Pistachio. And Mitt Romney is an unprincipled has-been. However, having taken this nonsense as seriously as it has, the Post then finds an administration official willing to say that the sky is a lovely shade of burnt sienna.\n",
      "\n",
      "White House aides say they are confident that Obama can pay respects to the victims of the war—on both sides of the Pacific—without provoking a major political backlash in the United States. The feeling within the White House is that a Hiroshima visit, while not crucial to the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance, would offer the president another opportunity to recognize history without being, in his words, \"imprisoned\" by it.\n",

      "At the end of season five, Lena Headey was playing a disgraced Cersei Lannister on Game of Thrones. The once-powerful monarch had become a powerless prisoner and victim of public shaming. As viewers might recall, Lannister was submitted to a penance walk that required her to strip down naked, get her hair shaven off and walk through the slums of town as disgusted onlookers shouted slurs and threw rubbish at her. Plus, a nun-looking Silent Sister followed her about town robotically ringing a handbell and saying, \"Shame!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not Cersei's best moment, and according to an interview with Entertainment Weekly, it wasn't one of Headey's either. The actress had received a lot of flak for opting out of filming the scene nude and using a body double instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some people thought I was less of an actress because I didn't get my tits out,\" she said, revealing that numerous factors like the intense vulnerability of the scene, how she would have reacted while filming and having children all weighed in on her decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told EW:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know what? It was really a bit shocking. I've done nudity. I'm not adverse to it. But I know I'm a very emotional actor and I get really driven by that. In order to do my job, I allow myself to be really vulnerable. I don't know any other way to do my job. Things really affect me. And the thought of being naked for three days and trying to contain her in the way she would be I think I would feel very angry. I didn't want to be angry. I don't think Cersei would be angry. I did what I thought she would do, emotionally. And wonderful Rebecca [Van Cleave, Headey's stand-in] was able to contain herself and be naked. She found it very difficult, obviously. It's not a natural thing to do. I film every year and I have kids and they know me now and [being naked in the scene] was just too much on top of that. So yeah, people that get it thought it was great. I didn't phone it in; I was actually there for three days with Rebecca.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She also dropped some hints about Cersei in the upcoming episodes. According to Headey, this is the Lannister matriarch's \"most interesting season\" since she finds herself in such a low place. Her relationship with Jaime is also \"at an all-time weird level,\" Headey says.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the season as a whole, she calls it \"juicy,\" \"f*cking dark\" and \"emotionally clever.\" Guess we'll find out what that means in six days.\n"

      "The justices of the United States Supreme Court are supposed to be an earnest bunch, polite but firm in their treatment of the lawyers who come before the court to argue for their clients. But, at least for the four putative liberals on the Court, it must have been awfully tempting to look down at the plaintiff's table and, hearing counsel arguing against the president's legal right to issue executive orders on immigration, ask:\n",

      "\n",
      "Sometimes, I really hate good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case argued on Monday, United States v. Texas, is a direct confrontation between the states and the president's conception of executive power in the area of immigration law. In brief, Texas claims that the president's 2014 decision to use an executive order to defer action on undocumented immigrants will cost the state of Texas because of a whole host of new obligations—from driver's licenses to the price of public education. (The president's actions allowed about four million undocumented immigrants a chance to breathe a little easier.) The president's position is that Texas doesn't have the right to bring this action at all. The energy under the case, of course, is the constant and undying idea that this particular president doesn't have the right to act like a president in ways that his political opponents find unseemly. (The gracious souls of the U.S. House Of Representatives got 18 minutes to argue against the administration before the Court.) Between this, and the Zubik case that was argued last month, we may be seeing the last cases brought under the unique legal theory that, in 2009, Barack Obama did not acquire the full powers of the presidency the way his more conventional—and whiter—predecessors did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question is does Texas have the right to bring this case,\" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"Texas says if you give legal status to these people, then we'll have to give them drivers licenses. The federal government says there's nothing in this law about drivers licenses. This law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves, it does not impose any obligations on the states. So the states should not have the right to challenge it. That's the standing argument. I think the Obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case, whether it is lawful.\"\n",

      "There might have been an interesting—and significant—question of constitutional law to be argued in this case, assuming that the case had been brought with an ounce of good faith whatsoever. But, in the context of the stated desire of the Republicans in Congress to use all means, fair or foul, to hamstring the presidency of any Democrat elected to the office, and especially this one, then that question gets subsumed in the context of the ongoing political vandalism that passes for political philosophy. The reports from the oral arguments on Monday seem to indicate that the Court is split along the now-customary 4-4 lines, although more than one observer has noted that the standing issue might be a lifeboat in which the Court could escape from a 4-4 ruling on executive powers, which would be a mess. In addition, and even though we know that electoral politics never plays a role in the Court's decisions, it might just rule against Texas on the standing issue because the justices know that whoever gets elected in November can rescind this president's actions the moment he or she is sworn in. Never underestimate the power of the passed buck, especially among those people with lifetime tenure.\n"

      "A preserved skull recently discovered in Argentina belongs to an enormous dinosaur called Sarmientosaurus musacchioi, paleontologists announced in a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Sarmientosaurus could provide a lot of new insight into a class of dinosaurs called Titanosaurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Discoveries like Sarmientosaurus happen once in a lifetime,\" paleontologist Rubén Martínez said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLOS ONE The Sarmientosaurus skull.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paleontologists rely on fossils, especially the skulls, to figure out how dinosaurs looked and how they used to behave. There are over 60 species of Titanosaurs discovered so far, but most of those fossils are incomplete, and we don't know much about them. That's why finding such a pristine skull like this one is a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Titanosaurs included the biggest land animals ever, so we want to know as much about them as we can,\" Matt Lamanna, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, said in a statement. \"But to truly understand a creature, you need to have its head. And because Titanosaur skulls are super-rare, lots of important aspects of how these dinosaurs lived and behaved have really been anybody's guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we finally have some insight. Paleontologists think the Sarmientosaurus lived around 95 million years ago and likely grew to about 40 feet long and weighed about 10 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on CT scans of the skull, it had a pretty small brain compared to its large body size. Paleontologists also think it had better vision and better hearing than many of its Titanosaur relatives. The specialized hearing may have helped it track predators or the movement of its own herd, paleontologists speculate. The bone structure suggest the Sarmientosaurus spent much of its time looking down, which probably means it ate primarily ground-based plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Sarmientosaurus skull is beautifully-preserved, which meant that we could tease out a ton of information,\" paleobiologist Lawrence Witmer said in a statement. \"It was really exciting for us to work through the CT scan data because it gave us a glimpse into the biology and lifestyle of this animal like we rarely get with dinosaurs.\"\n",

      "They teach history all wrong. Dates are important, sure, but the reality of it is, no one remembers the dates without the deeds, and when the deeds include 400 slaves becoming British soldiers and duking it out with Andrew Jackson in Florida? Well, you start to wonder why it’s not already a Tarantino flick.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1814, British Rear Adm. Sir Alexander Cochrane, skirmishing with the United States on the Atlantic and along the Gulf of Mexico as part of the War of 1812, had an idea. Not a particularly novel one, as it followed a similar action in 1808 and was generally drawn from the Brit’s playbook of enlisting disease-resistant locals to “help.” But in a United States that many expected to throw itself apart — the Civil War bloodbath still a half-century off — it was novel enough to attract President James Madison’s attention. And interesting enough to pull Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson into the fray well before he showed any sign of presidential aspirations.\n",

Not to be outdone, Jackson made a similar offer in an 1814 speech in New Orleans to “Men of Color,” topping it off with “The President of the United States shall be informed of your conduct on the present occasion, and the voice of the representatives of the American nation shall applaud your valor, as your general now praises your ardor.” The good general, it should be noted, owned as many as 300 slaves throughout his life.\n",

      "So, perhaps not so surprisingly, 400 slaves/refugees took Cochrane up on his offer to become “blue jackets” in the Corps of Colonial Marines, grab guns and take a shot at a better life. A shot that started with their first fight at the Battle of Rumley’s Gut in Virginia. British Capt. James Ross, sounding surprised, noted that the corps involvement “was marked by great spirit and vivacity.” Something noted by U.S. leaders as well, who stepped up recruiting efforts and soon had about 500 Black soldiers, also fighting for the promise of some version of freedom. And just to be crystal clear about all of war’s strange bedfellowing, these were Black soldiers shooting and killing white soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Black volunteers in large numbers stepped forward to defend homelands which paradoxically deprived them of basic freedoms for which they fought,” Gerard T. Altoff wrote in Amongst My Best Men: African-Americans and the War of 1812. Despite all the discrimination, Altoff noted, “African-Americans stepped forward to serve, either in a civilian or a military capacity.” Fueled by? Hope, or perhaps a belief in American promises over British guarantees.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the war ended in 1815, battle after battle had been fought with more men lost to disease than combat. The Brits made good on their offers, with some of the soldiers following them to Bermuda, the Bahamas, Trinidad and various other island communities. And the ones who stayed behind? Promptly attacked by Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Negro Fort — a struggle that kicked off the First Seminole War and merciless campaigns against Native Americans.\n",

      "Why the Police Force Needs Hipster Cops\n",
      "The front-page headlines on police brutality just keep rolling. The response has been a kind of national head-scratching. Are body cams the solution? Different training? Or is this the legacy of centuries of structural injustice?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve got an idea of our own: hipster cops. At least recruit some of them to the force. It sounds a bit insouciant, we know, and it’s true that everyone hates on hipsters for their facial hair and fedoras. But substance-wise, there’s little doubt that the police force could use a shift in culture. Hipsters are as politically correct as you can get, and probably better at working in certain communities. Don’t even get us started on how cool their uniforms would be. Vegan boots, anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jokes aside, the challenge is very real: A recent Gallup poll shows that Americans’ confidence in police has dropped to the lowest level since the Rodney King trial, and subsequent riots, in 1992. Only 52 percent of Americans expressed “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in officers of the law. “Certainly, our image has never been more important than it is now,” says Michael, a lieutenant and 17-year-veteran of a municipal law enforcement agency in California. (Michael didn’t want his last name used.) Diversity on the force could help not just with community relations, he says, but also to usher in and train a new generation of law enforcement leaders. The National Association of Police Organizations did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the pond, no one wants to be a cop. The number of young police officers in England and Wales has fallen by nearly 50 percent in the past two years, according to Britain’s Police Federation. “The problem is police departments want people who are obedient and conformist,” says 32-year-old Jimmy Gallagher, an ex-policeman with London’s Metropolitan Police who left the force because he felt disappointed in its “sheepishness” and now runs Quiffed Owl, a music blog. “The police will never gain the public’s trust if they don’t embrace officers who can think outside the box.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, populating the force with bearded freethinkers may lead to some unruliness. Facial hair and visible tattoos are a no-no in many departments, Michael notes, which would likely disqualify the hipster with “the mustache that does not conform to the decade or even the century.” And judging by how hipsters have become a punchline in recent years, they might struggle to appear authoritative in front of gangsters and old ladies alike. As Cindy Chan, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Toronto explains, “We all are capable of holding more than one social identity, but merging two identities when they are at such odds with each other — that’s a real challenge.”\n",

      "A recent slate of laws that target trans and gender-nonconforming people for using public bathrooms that match their gender identities have come up for debate in several U.S. states — and those in favor of the anti-trans legislation have used the defense that they are necessary measures to \"protect\" children from \"predators.\" But the anti-trans panic is a pretty weak defense, as Jessica Williams pointed out Wednesday in a Daily Show segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with Colorado state representative and chaplain Gordon James Klingenschmitt, who has been vocal about his anti-LGBT views, Williams asked him what was so scary about trans people using the bathrooms they feel safe and comfortable in. \"They not only want to be confused about their own identity,\" he said, \"but they want the rest of us to be confused with them. Now they want the government to join them in that pretense? They're making us into liars.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "OPEC Report Suggests Massive Oil Price Rebound\n",
      "The headlines reacting to OPEC’s April Oil Market Report generally read “OPEC concerned about global oil demand” and as such, oil prices traded down slightly on April 13, despite an overall positive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I’m concerned about global oil demand also, so I thought I better read their report. Clearly, the commodity never performs well in the face of stagnant or shrinking economic activity – no commodity does – in fact, nothing does. Except maybe alcohol sales. In any case, I am concerned with exactly how worried OPEC was about global oil demand and by extension, global GDP growth. Guess what? It turns out that despite the green lobby’s insistence, world economic activity is strongly reliant on hydrocarbon consumption and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, what I found in the report was not so much concerns about GDP growth in various regions of the world, although these are expressed and reviewed, but rather the underlying prediction of a massive rebound in oil and gas activity during the second half of 2016! By extension, for non-OPEC production to rebound, the cartel must be assuming much higher oil prices beginning, well, about now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this foreshadowing that a big production cut deal will come out of the Doha Qatar meeting this weekend? Probably not. In any case, I keep thinking, what if OPEC told us oil prices were going up sharply, but they buried the news deep in an 85 page report and nobody noticed? Related: End Of An Era: Peabody Declares Bankruptcy\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe they did. However, the fact is OPEC did not mention surging oil prices or sharp increases in exploration and production activity in their report, but they implied it. As subtle as the implications were, those commentators that managed to read only the first page summary of the report failed to grasp its true meaning. But in fact, to make the numbers add up, the only explanation is that OPEC is very bullish on both oil prices and oil service activity. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "First it’s necessary to set the backdrop by reviewing oil and gas fundamentals at a 50,000 foot level. Overall, OPEC is expecting that global growth in oil demand (really all liquids demand) in 2016 will average 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d). That is, demand will average 94.2 mb/d vs the 93 mb/d average in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "These estimates are pretty much in line with other analysis like the IEA’s Oil market report (95 mb/d) and represent a slowdown in growth from the 1.5 mb/d increase seen 2014 to 2015. Demand growth is predicated on a global GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent vs 2.9 percent world GDP growth rate in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why OPEC estimates stronger GDP growth but slowing oil demand growth is another question altogether. Setting that aside, OPEC notes stability in first quarter PMI numbers in the U.S., weak, but respectable numbers in Europe and Japan, improving numbers in China and India, etc to support its GDP assumptions…OK I won’t argue. Clearly the risk to 2016 oil demand lies squarely in how reality aligns with these expectations…once again, no surprise there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do the world’s oil producers – battered and bloodied by an 18 month drop in prices - supply the additional 1.2 mb/d of oil the world is expected to burn in 2016? That is the $100 billion dollar question and this is where the fun starts! Why $100 billion? Because that is the magnitude of the reduction in investments in oil and gas development that companies have announced for 2016 relative to 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about private companies and other countries that don’t report to shareholders? Good question, but no doubt they are spending less in 2016 than 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here is where I start to sense that OPECs monthly oil market report and reality have, let’s say, diverged onto different paths. OPEC details how production is essentially falling all over the world after achieving strong growth in 2015. In particular, non-OPEC supplies grew by 1.5 mb/d to reach 57.1 mb/d in 2015. In 2016, noting the aforementioned large drop in CAPEX and the corresponding rig count, non OPEC production is expected to fall by nearly 800,000 bpd.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both cases, U.S. tight oil is leading the way. In particular, U.S. tight oil volumes are falling the fastest. They note that in March, these volumes are expected to be down over 700,000 bpd from their peak in the first quarter of 2015. They also note the falling rig count as a major driver, possibly leading to increasing rates of production declines during 2016. Got it – rig counts drop to the lowest levels since the 1980s, production falls hard. Especially in tight oil where new wells typically decline by 75 percent in their first year of production. No brainer there. Most analysts have realized this.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, what about the current oversupply you ask? Are they not just saying that the market will just absorb the excesses of a currently oversupplied market? Yes. However, based on their own estimates, the market is basically in balance today. As such, here is where their projections start to deviate from logic – or to suggest a rebound is upon us. Below is OPEC’s forecast of non-OPEC production by quarter. The group notes that the world has seen a sharp drop in oil production during the first quarter of 2016. Various sources have already reported much of this information. Importantly, OPEC is predicting larger decreases in production in the second quarter of 2016 as the drop in activity that accelerated last December, really starts to impact production. Once again, this is starting to be accepted by those that pay attention to the data. These declines have recently garnered some press attention and I believe played a role in the recent oil price rebound. Related: Is The Golden Age Of Gas Nothing More Than A Bubble?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all as expected – the global oil industry cannot grow volumes in a $30/bbl oil world. In fact, at that price, cash flows are insufficient to warrant investment even to the levels necessary to replace production – much less grow volumes. Many have been saying this and dropping production is the evidence that they are correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, fast forward to OPEC’s estimate for third quarter 2016. They predict flat production relative to the second quarter. Further, in the fourth quarter, they predict non-OPEC production growth!\n",
      "\n",
      "How will the world achieve this? It will require a massive reversal of capital spending, and therefore a massive increase in the rig count and oil service activity. How massive? We estimate that in the Eagle Ford shale alone, the rig count would have to increase by 100 percent and the working frac fleets by 150 percent just to keep production flat. I have often compared this type of change to turning a supertanker.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at this point, it may be too late! We are going to hit the dock…why? It typically takes six to nine months for rebounding service activity to impact volumes – maybe less in the shale plays? Maybe, we’ll see. But history has shown that most regions react much slower to price changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the previous point aside for a moment, take a look at fourth quarter estimates. Yes, OPEC is predicting that non-OPEC supplies grow by 500,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of 2016. In their estimates – half this growth – 270,000 bpd comes from the Americas with the U.S. leading the pack, growing volumes by 140,000 bpd from Q3 to Q4 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do this, the rig count would have to increase by something on the order of 3x current levels and all other oilfield services would necessarily steeply ramp up. This is achievable, but to get there, I believe would require oil to shoot to around $60-70/bbl and we would have to start right now. My real prediction is a slower ramp through the first half of 2017, mirroring a ramp in oil prices. The good news from this report is that this will happen at minimum, barring collapsing world GDP forecasts or surging OPEC volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, OPEC is not just predicting increasing volumes in the Americas – they are predicting increasing fourth quarter production everywhere! Asia, Latin America and Africa are expected grow volumes by a combined 100,000 bpd off the 3Q 2016 lows while both Russia and China add 50,000 bpd each. Even Europe is expected to kick in growth of 130,000 bpd.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of today, production is falling in all of these regions. Sober analysts have been downgrading production estimates almost universally for the past few months. Likewise, service companies have been steadily lowering revenue estimates for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As such, what changes in the third and fourth quarters? We are in mid-April now. The fourth quarter is only a short 5 months away – the industry better get going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so one does not believe that OPEC is behind the times, they note the massive drop in activity levels that accelerated in the first quarter. Below is an up to date representation of what we are living in the U.S. Far from any kind of rebound, the charts below seem to suggest the industry is going to zero!\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "The momentum of the declines seen in the first quarter further highlight OPEC’s prediction of a second half rebound in volumes. The following is their estimates of both U.S. and total Americas supply growth. In both cases, after falling hard first to second quarter of 2016, volumes are flat in the third quarter and increasing again in the fourth. The only explanation for this is massive reinvestment driven by a massive increase in spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe not. Let’s look at some alternative explanations. Maybe OPEC is scared that shale producers have gotten so good extracting oil from impermeable rock that only a slight pickup in price may lead to massive new volumes. OPEC cites a quote by Pioneer Natural Resources that said they could put as many as five rigs back to work if oil stabilized above $45/bbl. With Pioneer’s rig count dropping from over 40 to 12 in the past 12 months, five incremental rigs is not going to spell rebounding U.S. production. Related: Tesla And Other Tech Giants Scramble For Lithium As Prices Double\n",
      "\n",
      "While the industry is getting more and more efficient, the laws of large numbers are immutable. With tens of thousands of horizontal wells declining daily, several thousand new wells are required to replace these volumes, and there is no evidence of any rebound yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the bottom line for OPEC. In the following chart, “required” OPEC production – meaning volumes required to balance the global market which considers the inputs of supply and demand for the world– are shown in the orange line. The blue bars are actual OPEC production. With actual production exceeding “required” production, global inventories rise and the oil price tanks. Historically, OPEC would pull a few barrels off the market to assure this didn’t happen. In November of 2014 they famously didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, assuming flat OPEC volumes, based on this chart, supply and demand are effectively in balance in 3Q 2016. In fact, demand slightly exceeds supply implying that high global inventories begin to drop. This is the point where prices stabilize and begin to rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth quarter, as shown, demand for OPEC volumes is falling. However, keep in mind that this is predicated on increasing production volumes from the rest of the world. An assumption that could only come true if a massive rebound in oil prices and activity started today.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, what is likely to happen is the third quarter call on OPEC will be about 1 mb/d above supply, resulting in strong inventory draws. This will push oil prices to the highest levels seen at least over the past 12 months. Given this signal, the industry will start to put capital back to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this will take a while – most of those laid off last year and this have found other jobs. Remember the 6-9 month lag between increases in rig count and volume growth? It could be even longer before volumes are truly growing again. If not in the U.S., certainly in the most of the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, let’s say fourth quarter is flat with our revised third quarter. Then the call on OPEC would be around 1.5 mb/d, resulting in further reductions in global inventories. In addition, oil prices would likely head higher and the strip would enter backwardation, prompting further draws from inventories. Under this scenario, non-OPEC volumes are unlikely to grow sufficiently to meet global demand until the second half of 2017. To achieve this, rising oil prices are just around the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every cycle, analysts and pundits try to make sense of the current environment. When oil prices were above $100/bbl, many argued such high prices were necessary because global F&D costs had risen to that point. Likewise, at the bottom, many have argued that $30/bbl is the new price level and given OPEC’s low marginal costs, prices could not rise. Neither was true. Prices and supplies are cyclical and the oil market is self-correcting. Wells decline daily. Cash must be invested in large quantities just to keep production flat and even in larger quantities to grow production.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, the only way OPEC can make these projections is through sharply rebounding oil prices. Further, to make these numbers, this has to begin now. So in reality, maybe they are telling us without actually telling us, that they are about to hit us with a price shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think so. I think they want to avoid any such messy outcome. However, we can recognize that the correction process is happening. But the rebound in investment is nowhere in sight making it unlikely that volume declines suddenly stop and then reverse in the second half of 2016. What this really tells me is that prices got out of control, dropped much further than the cartel expected, but they couldn’t reverse course without losing credibility. Maybe we all will be better off when they just leave markets alone.\n",

The band’s catalog has approximately 6.5 million monthly listeners, and listeners streaming the band’s most popular “album,” the greatest hits record One, total over 100 million alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, it appears that most of the fans lapping up the lads from Liverpool are younger listeners. According to the data in the report, 67 percent of those listening to The Beatles on Spotify are under the age of 35. That said, since the majority of Spotify users are below the age of 35 in the first place, the band isn’t exactly struggling with more seasoned ears — 35 percent of 6.5 million monthly listeners, around 2.275 million, is a pretty massive number of listeners on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the catalog launched on Spotify in late December, total Beatles plays number somewhere around the quarter billion mark. That’s a staggering number to achieve in such a short amount of time, and puts the band among the most-streamed artists on the service in the 100 day time frame during which their music has been available.\n",

      "The NRA seems like an easy target for a late night host, but that didn't stop Samantha Bee from demonstrating just how absurd and hypocritical their regulations are. On Monday's Full Frontal, Bee went to great lengths to try and acquire a costume for the organization's mascot, Eddie Eagle. The NRA uses the bird to teach kids the importance of gun safety, and apparently, his costume is harder to retrieve than an actual firearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It turned out the organization that makes it easier to get a gun than Sudafed, makes it nearly impossible to acquire their giant dancing eagle,\" Bee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the host discovered at the beginning of her quest, there are several hoops to jump through to acquire an Eddie Eagle costume. For starters, there is a 20-day waiting period for costume applications, and you won't have any luck online, as the NRA bans the resale of the costume as well. Pretty strict stuff, all the more farcical when it's much easier to purchase a gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you know what I could still buy online without a big hassle?\" Bee posited. \"A used shotgun on armslist.com from a random guy down the road from the TBS headquarters in Atlanta. So I had one of my employees buy it from him in a parking lot without a background check from the trunk of his car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Incredibly, Bee's lengthy process to get a costume ended in failure, even after she tried to bribe an in-costume Eddie to get the garb for $3,000 in cash. However, she was able to purchase several guns in the process, and decided to create her own mascot, using the guns as raw materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's certainly more frightening than the original mascot, but then again, it's more terrifying to know how easy it was to purchase guns at conventions, stores and even a parking lot.\n",

      "Hillary Clinton Just Took a Surprising Position on the $15 Minimum Wage\n",
      "BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Throughout her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton has consistently said that she supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. But at the CNN Democratic debate on Thursday evening, she admitted to at least one circumstance in which she'd sign a $15 minimum wage into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fairly early on in the debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked, \"If a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?\" Clinton replied, \"Of course I would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The response was surprising — Clinton has in the past made it clear that while she's generally supportive of workers agitating for a $15 minimum wage and approves of the wage on a city and statewide level, she drew the line at $12 for the federal wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders made it clear that this was news, and implied that it was either a mistake or an act of expediency in response to being cornered by a particularly probing question from Blitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour,\" Sanders said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton replied that she's consistently \"supported the Fight for 15\" and there was nothing inconsistent about her position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think setting the goal to get to 12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to 15, but of course if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to 15,\" Clinton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Clinton being inconsistent on a minimum wage? It's a little unclear. In the past she's said that she believed that a federal $15 minimum wage could have an adverse effect on the labor market of some cities and states — it appeared that a concern about higher unemployment was what was holding back her support for a full $15 wage. But when during the debate she said she'd green light it if a bill was sitting in front of her, it sounded more like her support for a $12 wage was a calculation about political possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arguably Clinton is being consistent if she holds the view that if gets through Congress, it reflects confidence from Congress that local economies across the country can handle the wage without an uptick in unemployment. But in an age of extraordinary congressional polarization and bills that are passed by narrow majorities, it's difficult to argue that the bill would be a faithful reflection of popular will or represent a comprehensive assessment of economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the clearest takeaway from the exchange is this: there's a consensus in the Democratic Party that the minimum wage needs to increase dramatically, and soon.\n",

      "Harriet Tubman Is the Perfect Choice for the $20 Bill\n",
      "In a few years, when you pull cash out of the ATM, you may end up looking at a woman's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost a year ago, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that a woman would appear on the $10 bill. But the popularity of the musical Hamilton, and renewed interest in the man, complicated matters. So now, rumors are circulating that Lew will announce that Hamilton will stay on the $10, a woman will appear on the $20, and Andrew Jackson, whose face currently occupies the front of the $20 note, will move to the back. Replacing him on the front, reportedly, will be Harriet Tubman, who won the Women on 20s online poll last spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to imagine a more fitting choice: A woman born into slavery who shepherded so many enslaved people to freedom through her Underground Railroad taking the place of a mass murderer, a genocidal man who worked as a slave trader and went on to force tens of thousands of Native Americans off their land through the Indian Removal Act, many of them dying on the Trail of Tears. If there were ever a guy to kick off the currency, Jackson is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what a woman to take that spot. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery in her 20s, fleeing Maryland for Philadelphia — and immediately returning to smuggle her family north. She went back down to the South again and again, bringing more slaves north, even helping to ferry people to Canada when the Fugitive Slave Law left them vulnerable even in Northern states. Tubman famously \"never lost a passenger\" on her Underground Railroad, and her work earned her the nickname \"Moses.\" She started out as a nurse in the Union Army before becoming a spy and an armed scout — she freed at least 700 enslaved people in the Combahee River Raid as the first woman in the war to lead an armed expedition. After the war, she was also an activist for women's voting rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman's service to her nation, though, went under-recognized in her lifetime, and she lived in a state of financial stress. The standard war veteran pension at the time was $25 a month; after the death of her second husband, Tubman was granted $8 a month. After a year of fighting, Congress gave her a little bit more: $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "That her face could be on that bill sends a strong message: In a country where little matters more than money, women matter too. It would be nice if we could put the face of a female president on the bill, but we've never had one of those. And it would be nice if we could say that the kind of gender discrimination Tubman faced when she was given an $8 pension and then a $20 one was a thing of the past, but still, women make a fraction of what men do — and black women make even less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain a country in which women are in many cases second-class citizens, facing unequal treatment, left largely out of leadership positions, and marginalized in politics. For every woman in Congress, there are four men. A woman just may win the presidency this year, but she will be the first in 200 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman on the $20 bill won't fix any of this. But the way boys understand what it means to be men and girls understand what it means to be women is through a complex interplay of adults modeling behavior, cultural norms, and symbolism. When our representations of leadership and patriotism are all white men, it sends a message that leadership and patriotism are male things. That message can't be countered only with the promise that girls can be anything they want to be, contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Tubman on the $20 makes clear that women have shaped this country for the better and have made invaluable contributions — contributions they made despite being largely barred from political participation. That she will replace a man who engineered a genocide of this county's native population could not be more appropriate or more reflective of how much times may have changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming, that is, that times actually have changed and it happens. There's no confirmation yet from the Treasury Department, and it seems that even if Tubman (or any woman) replaces Jackson on the $20, it'll be 14 years until any of us actually see her face in green. That's more than three times as long as the Civil War and comes after a century of women waiting to see a female face on a bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women have waited long enough, and Americans have had to stare at Andrew Jackson's face coming out of the ATM for far too long. In a few years, cash may be obsolete and we'll all be paying with cards or our phones or some sort of retina scanner hooked directly to our Bitcoin stash. Sometime before that, it would be nice to open my wallet and see a few Tubmans inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update 4/20, 5:30 p.m.: In a post on Medium, Lew announced that Tubman will appear on the $20 bill, and Jackson will move to the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamilton will stay on the front of the $10 bill and the back will welcome several women's rights icons. Writes Lew: \"Treasury's relationship with the suffrage movement dates back to the March of 1913, when advocates came together on the steps of the Treasury building to demonstrate for a woman's right to vote, seven years prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment. The new $10 design will depict that historic march and honor Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Alice Paul for their contributions to the suffrage movement. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "The $5 bill keep Lincoln on the front, and on the back will \"depict the historic events that have occurred at the Lincoln Memorial,\" including Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Alexander Hamilton was a U.S. president. He was the first secretary of the treasury but never served as president. This has been corrected.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "An ultra-realistic robot was unveiled last week by researchers from the University of Science and Technology in China (USTC). Jia Jia, as the female robot has been named, is apparently capable of basic communication, interaction with nearby people, and natural facial expressions. Unfortunately, many of her pre-programmed interactions appear to be highly stereotypical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: See here for a vacuum cleaning robot\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if Jia Jia detects that someone is taking a photo of her, she’ll warn the photographer to stand back or else the picture will make her face “look fat.” Jia Jia can’t do much beyond that though. Essential human emotional responses like laughing and crying are not in the robot’s repertoire. Her hands have also been left lifeless. She does, however, speak super subserviently. The prompt, “Hello,” elicits the reply, “Yes my lord. What can I do for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Related Offer: What can you build? Try your hand with robotic kits here\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve seen a few other ultra-realistic female robots recently. A few weeks ago a 42-year-old product and graphic designer from Hong Kong revealed “Mark 1,” a $50,000 female robot he built himself to resemble Scarlett Johansson. The project, which took a year and a half to complete, was supposedly the fulfillment of a childhood dream. Like Jia Jia, Mark 1 is capable of basic human-like interaction, command responses, and movement. Mark 1 actually outperforms Jia Jia in that the former can move its limbs, turn its head, bow, smirk, and wink.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s just the most recent example. Last year researchers at the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka University in Japan and Shanghai Shenqing Industry in China revealed Yangyang, a dynamic robot with an uncanny resemblance to Sarah Palin. Yangyang also seems to do more than Jia Jia with its abilities to hug and shake hands.\n",

Team director Chen Xiaoping says he hopes to develop and refine their creation, equipping it with artificial intelligence through deep learning and the ability to recognize people’s facial expressions, according to Xinhua News. Chen hopes Jia Jia will become an intelligence “robot goddess.” He added that the prototype was “priceless” and would not yet consider mass production.\n",

      "After spending the better part of a year focused on tearing down his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, frontrunner Donald Trump is now training his sights on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton — and he's signaling he'll be just as unsparing in attacking the former secretary of state as he was in going after \"little\" Marco Rubio, \"low-energy\" Jeb Bush and \"lyin'\" Ted Cruz.\n",

      "Kelly Ripa earned her fair share of criticism in the past week — but Tuesday morning, she fought back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripa, a 15-year veteran of the Live franchise, learned quite suddenly last week that Live With Kelly and Michael co-host Michael Strahan would be leaving the show to take a permanent spot on fellow ABC program Good Morning America. After the surprise, Ripa walked off her show, and critics quickly labeled her a \"diva.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Ripa didn't use her return as a chance to call her treatment unfair or to lambast Strahan. Instead, she thanked fans for their support and used her platform to call for something relevant and vital: \"respect in the workplace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripa was reportedly given the chance to speak her mind without previous vetting of her show-opening monologue, which she delivered standing, with Strahan out of frame. She joked about the off-the-cuff nature of it, saying, \"I'm going to be completely honest. I'm fairly certain that there are trained professional snipers with tranquilizer darts in case I drift too far off message.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She called the support she received from fans \"overwhelming,\" and said she walked off because she needed time to collect her thoughts. \"After 26 years with this company, I earned the right,\" she said. \"Let's be honest. I know half of you called in sick to be here, so we get each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase \"the right\" was a well-chosen one on Ripa's part — an insistence on being treated fairly by ABC after devoting much of her life to her workplace. She hinted at that greater connection when she called Live With Kelly and Michael \"my second home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a place that I've devoted myself to not just because of you, our loyal viewers, but because of all of the producers and the crew who work on this show,\" Ripa said. She also emphasized how pleased she was that in addition to having received apologies from higher-ups, \"our parent company has assured me that Live is a priority.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's on a nationally syndicated morning show or in a more traditional office, workplace respect is vital. Research has shown such respect can boost not just employee morale but actual productivity. That Ripa would not only put her foot down for fairer treatment from her employers, but use her platform upon her return to preach the gospel of a workplace that respects its employees, is commendable.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Ripa did cut the tension with a joke, giving everyone some perspective. \"I just wanna say one thing,\" she said. \"My dad, who was a bus driver for 30 years, thinks we're all crazy.\"\n"

      "\n",
      "During a recent chat with the Hall of Justice Podcast (via ScreenRant), Oliva said that he didn't believe Batman's \"Knightmare\" sequence to be a literal dream, but an impression of a possible future or alternate reality, being delivered to him when The Flash traveled through time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You want to know the answer? Okay… you’ve watched The Flashpoint Paradox, my movie, right?” Oliva said. “In the DC Universe in the comics, there’s this thing where –- it’s a little different than the Back to The Future thing where you can go back in time and change your threads and stuff, but in DC, when you go back in time you create this kind of ‘Time Boom’ kind of thing where lots of things change. “Okay, so let me just tell you this. Again… I don’t know if this is Zack’s thinking, but this is mine: what if that isn’t a dream sequence? What if what you saw was a Time Boom, a latent memory from the future when Flash comes back? If you look at the cut, he doesn’t go to sleep! He’s waiting for the [Lexcorp file decryption] and suddenly this [Knightmare sequence] comes in, and he’s jogged out of it seeing his own death. And what does he see? He sees Flash. And if you’re a DC fan, you know what’s happening. You know that Flash going back in time, that memory is now coming back to him… mind you, it’s jumbled.”\n",

      "If that's the case, what does it mean? Well, about the same as any other theory that held it's a potential future -- that it's possible, but more likely that they'll eventually stop the future from coming to pass by sending The Flash back in time to motivate Batman to put the League together.

      "Today, we'll continue with Daryl Dixon. Daryl has been a popular choice as Negan's victim since before Negan even arrived on The Walking Dead TV series. The character has never existed in the comics so he's the one true wildcard of the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most popular reasoning behind Daryl being killed off is that he has a new series on AMC called Ride with Norman Reedus. Many fans suspect this will create a scheduling conflict and was only greenlit because Reedus has plenty of free time following Daryl's death in the season six finale. Another theory that has been gaining some steam in comment sections is one regarding the \"point of view\" style the episode concluded with. Throughout the finale, the camera showed a certain character's perspective as they were locked up in the back of the Saviors' van where Rick and the group would eventually be trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only candidates, in this case, are Glenn, Michonne, Daryl, and Rosita. Rosita's death would have very little impact on the show. Rick would have almost certainly interjected if Michonne were the victim and Glenn's death wouldn't surprise fans with knowledge of the comics. Daryl's death makes an impact on the story line and also shocks fans. In addition, most cast members have said they either don't know who the victim is or elected not to talk about it. Norman Reedus, on the other hand, went on Good Morning America to say that he knows what happens and called it \"gutwrenching.\" Could he be the only one to know because it's him? By these standards, the death must have been handed to Daryl Dixon.\n",

      "Every time I waddled into her office, deep in the throes of the third trimester of my third pregnancy, 65 pounds heavier than my normal self and peeing myself every time I coughed, my midwife would gush, \"You look so beautiful.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "I felt like I owed it to all the women who wanted babies and couldn't have them, or all the women who had legitimately complicated pregnancies, or the strangers who commented on pregnancy being the most beautiful time in a woman's life to pretend like I felt that glow, that je ne se quoi. But I didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I had to practice deep breathing just to quell the panic that I was never going to fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans again. I wish someone had told me it's OK to feel more like a clump of hair in a shower drain than a maternal goddess on a mountaintop. I wasn't going to mommy hell for daring to think something negative about the process of cooking my little one. It's a gross process. It's weird. It's foreign. And that's OK too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perspective is a funny thing. I look back at photos of myself when I was pregnant and feel sexy. I looked far more inviting and voluptuous than I thought I did at the time. But I haven't forgotten how waddling about in a body so different from the athletic one I'd taken for granted wasn't easy. For weight-conscious women, it can feel terrifying, like a complete loss of control. It wasn't fat-shaming to say I felt ugly. It was an acknowledgement of my truth: My body was changing. Possibly for good. I wasn't able to run as fast or jump as far or get into the deep backbends that are part of my daily yoga practice. Would I ever get it back? I was scared.\n",

      "This isn't to say that the people who tell us we are lovely when we are preggo are lying. Quite the contrary. Even though I hated my body when I was pregnant just two short years ago, I find myself gushing to pregnant women: \"You are glowing,\" \"Wow, pregnancy becomes you,\" or, \"You have never looked better.\"\n",

But I should know better than anyone that if they aren't feeling it, it doesn't matter what I say. Yes, there are women who felt gorgeous when they were pregnant, sure. But once you get a group of seasoned mamas chatting, you quickly find out those of us in the ugly preggo club are not alone. \"I never felt less attractive than when I was knocked up,\" one friend told a group of us when we were chatting about our pregnant bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But voices like my friend's are drowned out by the voices that tell women how they \"should\" feel during this magical time — alive! Brimming with joy! More beautiful than ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, our culture often seeks to shame and guilt pregnant moms for what we eat, how much we eat, how much we exercise (or don't). The news is full of Scary Pregnant Lady Headlines! You could get that disease from eating this cheese. Don't wear this fabric or your baby will have cancer. Don't drink this drink or you will have a miscarriage. Maybe hating our bodies is the natural response to all that scrutiny. Maybe it's not the fat we hate, but the sudden notion that our bodies are public property, subject to the judgment and belly rubs of any passing stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a pregnant woman, what I wanted more than anything was to feel like myself. So I'm declaring a moratorium on all the \"glow\" talk. From now on, when I see a pregnant woman, I plan to compliment her outfit, her smile, her work accomplishments. If I must bring up appearance, a simple \"you look lovely\" will do the trick, and if she complains and says she feels anything but, I promise not to argue. She doesn't owe me — or anyone — feigned maternal bliss.\n",

If it disintegrates completely, it could dump enough water into the world's oceans to raise sea levels by 12 feet, a disastrous scenario that could see many of the world's greatest cities—New York, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Venice—go Full Atlantis.\n",

But a big part of that is down to United States involvement and leadership, something that's sort of on the table this November.

      "Jessica Williams had never done molly, but a guy friend offered it to her at a house party. She’s not one to say no to new experiences, so she took the pill and swallowed it. A couple of hours later, after some flirting and back-and-forth, all she wanted to do was talk and get to know Ryan Callen, deeply. They ditched the party and spent the next several hours sitting on his bed, face-to-face and cross-legged, talking about their fears, ambitions and most closely guarded secrets. “Everything just seemed so real, like we were both saying exactly what we were feeling,” she says. Yes, there was physical chemistry, but it was the emotional intimacy that surprised them both. He asked her then and there to be with him, to date exclusively. She said yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she woke up worried it was just “molly love.” The thought of dating him hadn’t ever crossed her mind. “It sounds so wild, but I honestly don’t think I would have been with him if it wasn’t for that night of MDMA,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "MDMA isn’t new, and neither is research into its effects on human connection, but it wasn’t until the very early 2000s that the FDA warmed to the idea of new research into the potential legal uses of MDMA. It remains banned as a Schedule 1 drug — these range from marijuana to heroin— but under the law could be used in FDA-approved research settings. Psychedelics are now considered by some to be a legitimate cure for trauma, and it’s “highly unlikely” that there will be any turning back, argues Brad Burge, the communications director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), the organization running the nationwide studies. Publicly available psychedelic-assisted therapy is on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, MDMA is making other kinds of strides. Having been popularized for its use in partying and treating PTSD, it’s finding love with a new crowd — PR people, finance guys, social-media managers — people who aren’t trying to fix anything or get fucked up. Rather, they’re seeking an experience with something less sensational but perhaps ultimately more exciting: intimacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy in question, and in demand, is not just the sexual kind. Christina Miller, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate who’s applying to med school, got into one of those fights with a friend that left them both angry and silent. That is, until that friend showed up to a gathering rolling hard on MDMA. All of the issues were forgotten, says Miller, thanks to that extra dose of artificial love. The resolution lasted. “If she didn’t do molly that night, we might not have been friends,” says Miller. People also use it to find a truer sense of their own selves. “Ecstasy can really open your heart,” says former porn star and sex worker advocate Annie Sprinkle, adding that it can also remind you how to feel good when you’ve forgotten. When she was 32 and living in Manhattan, she was going through a dark patch and started doing MDMA alone, as a kind of therapy. She would sit in front of the mirror and hiss “like a Medusa,” combining it with masturbation and “deep profound sexual release.” She was letting go of her self-doubt. At the end, she says, it was the first time she truly ever loved herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how it works. MDMA puts memories in the right “filing cabinet” so they don’t rule your present life, Alison McQueen says, one of just a handful of psychedelic therapists in the U.S. For Ashley Jenkins, a 57-year-old sexual assault victim who’s suffered decades of PTSD, it allowed her to revisit painful experiences without reliving them. For the intimacy seekers, biologically, it increases the output of the feel-good signal senders in the brain like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, making you feel happier, more open and more touchy-feely. Megan Stubbs, a sexologist living in New York, says we live in this “hypersexualized” culture but that “there’s a disconnect trying to bring [sex] into daily life.” She argues that MDMA could bridge that gap for millennial women in particular. After all, 2.5 of the 2.6 million MDMA users in the U.S. are between 14 and 34, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. And the moment may be ripe, especially with feminism’s enduring pop-culture rise, with mainstream celebs and politicians using the word once saved for more leftist circles. It’s all about the touchy-feelies and openness, after all, generally considered “feminine” traits. One government study showed that teenage girls are more likely than boys to have tried the drug. On the flipside, crediting drugs with making people more sexual has its dangers. “It has to be a holistic view,” Stubbs says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this new era of MDMA use has its roots in what our conservative readers might call hippie bullshit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Stubbs says there are “mostly benefits” of MDMA for sex, since it makes people feel more intimate and more open to positive experiences, she cites “Intimate Insight,” a 2015 Journal of Psychopharmacology study that shows MDMA changes the way people talk about and to their significant others. Matthew Baggott, the lead researcher from the University of Chicago, and his co-researchers from Columbia University and the University of Southern California found that MDMA caused them to be more comfortable in their own skin and increased emotional connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve been waiting for us to bring up the guys in the Volkswagen vans and Yoko Ono T-shirts, your wait is over. Yes, this all has its roots in what our conservative readers might call hippie bullshit. Alexander Shulgin, the medical chemist and psychopharmacologist known as the godfather of ecstasy, had a special group of friends-slash-research-subjects, a close-knit crew of academics, business leaders and hippies. He would invite couples over to dinner to test new psychedelic compounds he concocted in his dirt-floor garden shed in California’s Berkeley Hills. The six-foot-four scientist would bring out a new potion, and after warning his guests of its possible effects, they would embark on a psychedelic voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "These dinner parties were some of the earlier tests in MDMA-related couples therapy. Shulgin synthesized an easy-made version of MDMA in 1976, a drug originally patented by German pharmaceutical company Merck in 1912 but quickly abandoned. He asked his friend and LSD creator Albert Hofmann what he thought of the new love potion. Hofmann responded, “Finally, something I can do with my wife.” A couple of years later, drawing on his dinner-party experiments, he published a paper calling MDMA “an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones.” Others caught on, like his psychologist friend Leo Zeff, a so-called underground therapist who used the chemical with thousands of patients, secretly. Shulgin’s drug-as-couples-therapy idea caught on and by the early 1980s, around 1,000 therapists were doing intensive MDMA therapy sessions, like Dr. George Greer, Zeff’s protégé, who tested the substance on 80 patients. He became the go-to guy on research and found that when they gave it to a couple together, their “intimate conversation” improved. And the effects lasted for months. Greer says it works this way: It blocks the neuropsychological fear response to a perceived emotional threat, so people aren’t afraid to say things. In general, they were “less defensive” when talking about relationship trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of high-profile deaths got the attention of the DEA and they banned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But love-inducing MDMA also helps some people get laid. And by the mid-1980s a quick and dirty version made it onto the Dallas club scene. Which might have brought us to the present-day experimentations with intimacy … except for the things that started going wrong. A couple of high-profile deaths got the attention of the DEA and they banned it. Practically overnight. Government money for research vanished. And this all happened against the backdrop of the booming crack epidemic and then–First Lady Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign. Ecstasy and intimacy receded into the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their fears weren’t unfounded. The molly sold on the street can be adulterated, and even in its purest form, MDMA has risks. The National Institutes of Health notes it’s not a benign drug — adverse effects range from chills and hypertension to heart or kidney failure. MDMA-induced hyperthermia can be fatal. And for those with cardiac issues, MDMA is particularly dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "And no one is saying that the resurgence is a recipe for happiness ever after. Or that MDMA is a silver bullet against ugly divorce rates. Drugs and relationships don’t always mix. Like the scene in season five of Mad Men in which Roger and Jane, two of the main characters, are lying on a furry rug at home, tripping on LSD. Their blissed-out state gives them calm clarity about their marriage … that it’s over. That’s part of the deal with psychedelics. They’re “mind manifesting,” the literal meaning of the word, and becoming aware of your inner thoughts can be brutal. Couples therapy is hard enough without the influence of drugs, says Constance Avery-Clark, a seasoned sex therapist and member of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research, adding that therapists “can’t compete” with drugs. She’s hesitant about any upside.\n",
      "\n",
      "But imagine walking down the street in any city and having access to psychotherapy clinics — cozy rooms with Persian rugs, calming music, green plants and trained therapists — where people can check in, stay the night and go home the next day, healed. Eventually these in-patient centers would treat all sorts of people, from bickering couples to Boomers who want to have freer sex. Burge thinks this will happen “within the next decade,” if not sooner. Meanwhile, the adventurous experiment in private, sometimes with life-changing results. “When you take MDMA, it completely fast-forwards, times a thousand, intimacy and relationships, and without that I wouldn’t be with who I am today. I’d look at him as just a friend,” says Williams. And today, she couldn’t be happier.\n",

      "A Tennessee lawyer and electronic music DJ, Chris Sevier, has filed a lawsuit in Texas because he cannot obtain a marriage license for him and his 2011 MacBook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sevier is suing the Harris County District Clerk, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton after failed attempts to marry his computer in several other states, the Houston Chronicle reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage is also a form of protest against the Supreme Court's June 2015 decision\n",
      "\n",
      "Sevier has previously sued Florida for the right to marry his MacBook and believes \"the Constitution is being hijacked,\" because of marriage equality, according to the Chronicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question is, should we have policies that encourage that kind of lifestyle?\" Sevier said to the Houston Press. \"The state is not doing anyone any favors by encouraging people to live that lifestyle. We have to define marriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press , Sevier plans to file lawsuits in at least 12 more states until he finds one willing to press \"power\" on his marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Texas, Attorney General Paxton has already fought Sevier's suit. \"The right to marry one's computer is not an interest, objectively, deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition such that it qualifies as a protected interest,\" Paxton's brief said, according to the Chronicle.\n",

      "Talking to Lincoln earlier this week, it would've been foolish not to ask if he knows who the victim is. As it turns out, the scene hasn't been shot in its entirety but Lincoln still isn't willing to give up any info. \"We all just made a pact not to discuss it,\" Lincoln explains. \"It's upsetting. It's too precious. There are certain things that become sacred on set and I'm afraid, I'm one of these people going, 'I can't talk about it.' Every time we've lost somebody on the show they've been instrumental in story telling. It's the same thing. We lock up shop. We linked arms, got our knees, and said, 'You know what?

      "A White House Concession on Fast and Furious\n",
      "Remember Fast and Furious? No, not the series of vehicle-themed Vin Diesel and Rock vehicles. The bizarre “gunwalking” scandal, in which the ATF let straw buyers purchase guns to traffic to Mexico, but intercept the firearms before they reached Mexico, snagging criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been mostly out of the news for the last four years, but on Friday, the White House announced it would drop claims of executive privilege and turn over a cache of documents to Congress related to Fast and Furious, as Politico’s Josh Gerstein first reported. The decision follows a court defeat in January for the Obama administration. Gerstein explains:\n",
      "\n",
      "In her ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson did not turn down Obama's privilege assertion on the merits. Instead, she said authorized public disclosures about the operation in a Justice Department inspector general report essentially mooted the administration's drive to keep the records secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the latest round in an ongoing battle between the White House and congressional Republicans over the operation. Almost inevitably, Fast and Furious was a fiasco. It didn’t snag any big fish, and the ATF lost track of 2,000 guns, including two that were found after the 2010 murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. The dispute is not over whether Fast and Furious failed, but over who is to blame. The Obama administration and the Department of Justice pinned the blame on the local ATF office in Phoenix. Republicans suggested that higher-ups—including the Attorney General Eric Holder or even President Obama—might have known.\n",

      "True or false? Women make braver leaders than men\n",
      "Reams of research show that women confer many benefits to companies. They listen better, they represent the views of half the population, and they temper their hard-charging (pdf) male counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except that it turns out, they are even more hard-charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, the CEO and president, respectively, of Zenger/Folkm, a leadership consulting business, designed a “boldness index” from a database of assessments from 75,000 leaders around the world. They found that “women on average rank in the 52nd percentile of boldness, a few ticks higher than the average men rating of the 49th percentile.” If that doesn’t seem like a big difference, that’s because it’s not. But their conclusion defies the conventional wisdom that women are biologically more harmonious and risk-averse compared to their fractious and ambitious male counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the components of their index, published in the Harvard Business Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges standard approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Creates an atmosphere of continual improvement\n",

      "Quickly recognizes situations where change is needed\n",
      "\n",
      "Has the courage to make needed changes\n",
      "\n",
      "Some might call the compilation of all those traits “innovative,” “smart,” or even ”common sensical”—they are leaders after all. And the index says nothing of the epic double standards women face around “being bold” and taking risks: aggressive men are leaders, aggressive women are difficult; men lead boldly, women are bossy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s clearly an issue to be addressed because when Zenger and Folkman analyzed their data to see how these traits materialized across different business functions. They found that in every function, women on average were braver, or more creative than men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context, they found, also matters: When they broke individuals into age groups, the data showed women step it up when they are in jobs dominated by the other sex. Women age 30 and under rated in the 62nd percentile for boldness in male-dominated functions like sales, but only the 42nd percentile in female-dominated roles such as engineering and safety. That could be because naturally bold women gravitate to those jobs, or because women in those jobs find they are most successful harnessing those traits.\n",

      "\n",
      "While a company would go bankrupt if it owed too much money, the same could not be said of the United States anytime soon, Icahn explained, reiterating that he can't \"understand this obsession\" that many Republican politicians have with the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They keep saying we owe all this money to China, but we're really not going to pay it back ever in a normal way,\" Icahn said. \"So China decides 'I want my money back.' OK, well how do you want it back? You want dollar bills, you want Treasurys, what do you want?\"\n",

      "Sarah Palin has donned her fighting gloves and she’s ready to land her finishing blow on opponent Azealia Banks. Forget Twitter fingers folks, things are about to get real ugly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former governor of Alaska has stated that she will take legal action against rapper Banks over a series of profanity-laced tweets the latter posted against her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the first time I’m going to enjoy the only retribution some protected ‘celebrities’ seem to understand,” Palin told People Magazine. “I’m suing Azealia Banks and can’t wait to share my winnings with others who have gone defenseless against lies and dangerous attacks far too long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moments after Palin revealed her intentions, Banks fired back with a thinly veiled retort dressed as an apology. Posted on her Tumblr — because 140 characters simply wasn’t enough to express the groundswell of emotion the rapper was feeling — the statement addresses everything from the commonalities between the two sparring women and the “critical white gaze” of which black stereotypes are, according to Banks, one proponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As i am an artist. I cherish my ability to express myself freely, yet remain totally aware that for every action, there will be a reaction. All in All, Woman to Woman, I hope you will accept my sincerest apology,” concludes Banks, before adding a teen pregnancy swipe at Palin’s daughter, Bristol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beef between the two outspoken ladies started when rapper Banks tweeted a response to Palin’s controversial statement regarding slavery. In her now deleted tweets, the rapper (who is no stranger to controversy) stated that the Republican politician should indulge in sexual acts with black men before commenting on such sensitive issues, to put it politely. Banks also added that the ensuing exploits should be recorded and uploaded to WorldStarHipHop, an infamous site known for publishing violent video clips. Palin obviously wasn’t impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had enough of the unanswered threats and attacks against my family and me,” Palin said in her statement. “Azealia engages in a form of racism and hate that is celebrated by some in the perverted arm of pop culture, but is condemned by those who know it’s tearing our country apart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In her Tumblr post, Banks clarified that she never claimed that Palin should be “raped,” and that the “right-wing conservative media” had twisted both her, and Palin’s, words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my honest defense, i was completely kidding. I happen to have a really crass, New-York-City sense of humor, and regularly make silly jokes in attempts make light of situations which make me uncomfortable,” writes Banks. “As the fabric of the American Nation is EMBEDDED with racism, I merely made a raCIALly driven joke to counter what i believed to be real, raCIST rhetoric.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, celebrities have sued others for what they deemed as libellous tweets. Most recently, actor James Woods was allowed the right to take legal action against an anonymous Twitter abuser. In 2014, singer Courtney Love won a landmark Twitter libel case, in which a Los Angeles county jury decided that she did not defame her former attorney in a tweet.\n"

      "\n",
      "There is more risk to the upside than downside. We tested the downside last year, and there was good trading support at the $1,050 level. So we've moved up the bottom of the expected range to $1,150-$1,200. The lower band moving up is of course a sign that there's danger related to hot money. Hot money came flooding in and drove up the price of gold in 2011, and some of that money could come back in. So it could go up a bit further and faster than we would like. A steady, $100 rise would be healthier.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Arab Emirates is used to building landmasses were there were none before, but creating a mountain from scratch is a whole new level. Nonetheless, the UAE is considering precisely that kind of construction. With hopes that it will encourage raincloud development in a country mostly covered in desert, the UAE is looking to build a full-sized artificial mountain. Desert flatlands make it difficult for air to get the upward climb required to collect into rain clouds, but creating a mountain could help bring a certain amount of rain to the otherwise arid region.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage, increased rainfall might be more suitable in, say, drought-ravaged California than a country naturally situated in the middle of the desert, but that’s beside the point. The UAE has commissioned a proposal from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in collaboration with the National Center of Meteorology and Seismology (NCAR), both United States-based scientific collectives. Researchers are currently looking to determine if this type of mountain construction would be possible in the UAE at all, let alone what the dimensions of the mountain would have to be in order to encourage a significant change in meteorological patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mountain just needs to increase cloud formation, not necessarily the formation of rainclouds specifically, says Roelof Bruintjes, scientist and lead researcher on the NCAR team. Once clouds begin to form, a meteorological process called cloud seeding increases the amount of rainfall that those clouds can release. But it looks like construction of the mountain itself is still only in the wishful thinking phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before any construction can begin on this artificial mountain in the UAE, the scientists and researchers at the NCAR have been tasked with pricing out the possibility of the project. If the government of the UAE decides that the projected price is feasible (with or without help from the deep pockets of local private investors in cities like Dubai), only then will a team of engineers tackle the project to see if building a mountain in the middle of the desert is physically possible.\n"

      "This Skills Gap Is Hurting America’s Housing Market\n",
      "While America’s housing market is recovering, the construction industry has struggled to catch up. Nationwide, the median price for existing and new single-family homes for sale shot up more than 8% during the past year. The rise, in part, signals good news in that the housing market has continued to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, but prices are also being driven up by a growing shortage of homebuilders and home improvement professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve heard plenty about America’s skills gap across the tech industry, but a skills gap is also hobbling construction — and it’s delaying building projects, shrinking building inventories, and inflating the cost of homes and home-related projects. The knowledge and skills necessary to repair our toilets, install our furnaces and build our houses are dying on the vine. And, unless we want our grandkids growing up in primeval teepees, we need to work quickly to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trend has been building up for years. In the 1990s, the American educational system (no doubt with the best of intentions) discontinued vocational classes and began to encourage all students to pursue a four-year college degree, creating significant, if unintended, consequences. First, fewer students were exposed to career options in the skilled labor trades. Second, the profound emphasis placed on college-level education perpetuated the notion that skilled (i.e., blue-collared) labor entails physically demanding, yet mindless work. And third, industry succession responsibilities were transferred to business owners lacking the time and resources required to fully train and educate would-be workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortage worsened in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the dark days of the housing crisis led the construction industry to lose more than 60% of its workforce to healthier industries, according to the U.S. Labor Statistics and Census Bureaus. That’s more than any other non-farm industry in the United States. One contributor, of course, has been diminishing immigration. The U.S. construction industry has lost more than half a million Mexican-born workers since 2007, according to a recent report by home-building analyst John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc, mostly as a result of increasingly restrictive domestic immigration policies and improving opportunities abroad. In an erratic election year, this has been a widely debated, hot-button issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lesser-debated, but no less impactful, contributor to the skilled labor shortage has been an ever-widening generational gap in the skilled labor workforce. During the Great Recession, fewer young people were hired, which meant the percentage of older workers in the industry grew faster than in other industries. As the U.S. Census notes: The percentage of 19- to 25-year-olds hired in the construction sector declined from approximately 18% at its peak before 2006 to 13% in 2012-2013, only to be replaced with workers 45 to 55 years old . As a result, the percentage of 45- to 55-year-olds employed in the construction sector has exceeded the employment share of this age group in all other industries.

      "Even as the housing market recovers today, the construction industry is playing catch up. The National Association of Home Builders reports that, although the residential construction industry has gained more than 433,000 positions since the lowest low following the Great Recession, the industry remains more than 1 million workers short of the workforce seen at peak 2006 levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homebuilding and home services businesses are stunted. Construction is expected to add jobs at the second-fastest rate among U.S. industries between 2014 and 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts, but business owners are struggling to fill open positions. In a recent HomeAdvisor survey, we found that 93% of home service professionals believe their businesses would grow in the next 12 months if not for hiring challenges. Further, while half of respondents plan to hire one to three skilled workers in the next 12 months, 76% feel it will be hard to find qualified new employees.\n",

      "The industry’s staffing shortages are also spawning major project delays — not to mention operational cost increases that are being passed on to consumers. In a June 2015 National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) survey, 58% of builders reported having difficulty completing projects on time, and 61% of builders reported raising home prices due to labor shortages in the previous 12 months.\n",

      "As a home services CEO, I see first-hand the impacts of the labor gap on our industry, our economy and our continued quality of life. Regrettably, I also see that it’s only going to get worse if we don’t make it better. With fewer migrant workers entering the workforce and an increasing number of aging skilled workers making their exit, there’s a need to attract and engage a healthy workforce to take over the essential roles they’re leaving behind. Fortunately, there are a number of things we can do to foster an interest in skilled labor among the nation’s younger workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we can reconnect the industry with educational institutions and seasoned professionals to reintroduce — and encourage — long-term career options in the skilled labor trades. Second, we can embolden entrepreneurship in young workers and underscore the great autonomy, flexibility and growth potential the industry affords. And finally, we can harness millennials’ newfound celebration of craftsmanship to tap into the “maker movement” and better position skilled laborers as the essential, authentic craftsmen young workers may aspire to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without skilled workers to replenish a diminishing skilled labor workforce, housing prices will continue to rise, housing inventories will continue to fall, and we’ll pay a growing premium for even the smallest home repairs (until there’s nobody left who knows how to complete them). So, whatever we do to address the skilled labor shortage, it’s imperative that we do something — and that we do something soon. Skilled labor has reached a breaking point, and if we continue to do nothing, our houses — so long as we can afford to keep them — will literally fall to pieces.\n",

In many cases, time has not told us what happened to the populations that have vanished en masse, all over the world.

The Smithsonian described a scenario in which the Easter Islanders deforested the land, which did a number on the soil, which made it nearly impossible to cultivate and opened the door to infighting.

I hope this isn't what you would tell your girls? Does your BOSS know that this is how you degrade other WOMAN? @hbcutravelers Internet BULLYING is not cool and it needs to stop. Would you say this to my face? Is this how you speak to yourself when YOU look at yourself in the mirror. Again, I'm shining a light on this issue hoping to see change. Love and uplift!

And perhaps Apple’s position as the big fish in a small pond of wearable competitors probably gives it the right to set the tone. Even as Apple’s somewhat halting approach to Apple Watch updates frustrates those who’ve come to expect bold, yearly updates on major product categories (like the iPhone), it would be foolish to mess with the design and major functions when you can incrementally build, quarter over quarter, to a sustainable business. Right?\n",

I’ve been wearing one on and off for a year and appreciate the excellent forward-leaning design (yes, I feel like I’m wearing a watch from the future) and the ever-present notifications and alerts. It really does free me from pulling my iPhone out of my pocket and, even to this day, I get “wow” or “cool” comments from TSA personnel and ticketing agents when I check into flights with the Apple Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, I’m the person Apple could always count on to buy an Apple Watch. Not just because I’m a tech geek, but because I’m a middle-aged guy who grew up wearing watches.\n",

      "If Apple (and other wearable manufacturers) want to grow beyond people like me, it has to make a number of key changes sooner, as opposed to later.\n",

      "I’m willing to accept that Apple will not introduce a redesigned Apple Watch now — and maybe not at any point this year — but there is one more body option they should consider because I think it could help them take the Apple Watch outside the fashion realm and, perhaps, into a space first pioneered by Swatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Apple Watch material should be a polymer (yes, basically a super-strong plastic).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of obvious benefits. First of all, the cheaper material will allow Apple to price what I like to call the Apple Watch Lite at $199. As most Apple historians will recall, $199 is what the late Steve Jobs called the magic price for technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "A polymer body would also allow for an endless number of through-and-through body colors. If you scratch the Apple Watch Lite, you won’t see unsightly metal, just more of the same color. It would also allow Apple to introduce patterned fluromaster bands and have the pattern carry through to the watch. Just think, a Hello Kitty Apple Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lower price should attract more Apple Watch customers. To bring in the customers who have never worn a watch, though, Apple will need to do at least, uh, one more thing.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bands, bodies and, more importantly, Apple Watch Lite faces would obviously start pre-loaded with faces to match the band and body designs. Imagine a kid Apple Watch with a Snoopy face, or a One Direction watch with the four remaining band members dotting the four corners of a watch face. Connecting Apple Watch design and interfaces to teen cultural touchstones would not only put the Apple Watch in demand for the Snapchat set, but turn each new design partner release into a cultural event.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are a few other things I would like Apple to do right now in lieu of a redesign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rethink digital touches. The idea of doodling to someone or sending them my heartbeat was fun for a few weeks, but it’s been months since I’ve used them. Apple should either make digital touches more visible on the watch or replace the functionality with a Snapchat function that lets you doodle or put text on watch face screen shots (or photos pulled from your iPhone) and send them along to friends who also have Apple Watch or those who don’t (just make it a Snapchat snap or iMessage).\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a One Direction Apple Watch Lite with the four-remaining band members dotting the four corners of a watch face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dump the app home screen. The more apps that appear in Apple Watch’s random app bubble cluster, the harder it gets to find anything. Most of the time, you’re not launching apps anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Apple Watch is at its best when telling time and delivering notifications, alerts and directions. They all pretty much happen on their own. Even directions, which work as a perfect complement to live navigation on the iPhone, launches and runs without me touching the watch. Perhaps there’s simply no need for an app home screen. I suggest replacing it with a better way of managing all those notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later this year or next, we will finally get a more radical Apple Watch redesign. I’m sure it will be beautiful and I will want it. In the meantime, though, it’s time for Apple to use its wearable market pole position to make some real market leadership moves.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Thanks to its legalization, marijuana is slowly shedding its stigma and creeping further into normalized lifestyles. One such way is through food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marijuana edibles remains relatively new territory for many, but people are picking up on its health benefits, including a high that's rather different from smoking. Eating marijuana processes it through the liver, so the chemicals of THC become metabolized into 11-hydroxy-THC, according to the Daily Beast. This process gives users a slower, longer high — which many medical marijuana patients have found useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make edibles, you need to fuse together marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, with a fat, such as oil or butter, in a process that starts off with something called decarboxylation, High Times reported. That's basically heating up the dry plant matter so that the THC loses its acid group and becomes active — it's similar to how you'd burn weed to smoke it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After decarboxylation, people can choose to infuse the marijuana with butter or oil. However, it's the oils with the highest fat content, like coconut or olive, that'll absorb the most THC, according to the Cannabist.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're making oil, keep it at low heat when you add the cannabis. Otherwise you risk burning off the THC, the Cannabist reported.\n",

      "When adding weed, don't just use whatever's sitting in your grinder: It's important to get the dosing right. Beginners should start with around 5 milligrams of THC; Colorado's serving size is 10 milligrams of THC, according to the Cannabist. Here's the math: On average, a single gram of cannabis has at least 100 milligrams of THC, so to get 5 milligrams of THC per cookie, you would want a recipe that made 20 cookies.\n",

      "For years, spiral-shaped holes, called puquios, that dot the dry landscape in Nazca, Peru, have confused archaeologists. But now, the BBC reports, a team of researchers using satellite images has mapped out the spread of the puquios, including previously unknown holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puquios are part of a \"sophisticated hydraulic system constructed to retrieve water from underground aquifers,\" Rosa Lasaponara of the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis, in Italy, who conducted the research, told the BBC. \"What is clearly evident today is that the puquio system must have been much more developed than it appears today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasaponara and her team used satellite images to analyze the placement of the puquios and realized the extent to which they moved water throughout the region. There is a system of tunnels underground, connecting the puquios. Each spiral hole pulls air down into the canals, moving the water through the network and bringing it to people who would have used it for both agriculture and domestic life, Lasaponara told the BBC. A more complete idea of how the puquios are connected also gives clues about when they were created, an issue long debated by archaeologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "To design such a system would have meant that the ancient Nazca people who built them had extensive knowledge about the geography of the area, Lasaponara told the BBC. The irrigation tunnels may also be connected to the Nazca lines, giant geoglyphs of animals, people and shapes carved into the Nazca desert, Lasaponara told the BBC.\n",

      "\n",
      "I spoke Rachel Zoe, designer and knower of all things clothing-related, to solve some of my laundry dilemmas. Zoe recently partnered with Downy to design four pieces that are 100 percent laundry-friendly for her fall/winter 2016 collection and cleared up some common misconceptions people have about washing their clothes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Myth 1: Dry-cleaning your clothing will prevent it from getting pilled and pulled.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you who overzealously dry-clean your clothes, read the labels on your clothing first! If something says \"do not dry clean,\" it probably means the fabric has a special coating that can be removed by dry-cleaning solvents, aka could cause your clothes to pill down the road. If this is the case, Zoe says washing your clothes in the washer can actually help the fabrics stay more in tact than dry-cleaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 2: Fabric conditioner (aka fabric softener) isn't necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clothing conditioner will protect the fibers in your clothing from abrasive damage that happens when you wash or wear it. Just like how your hair frizzes without using hair conditioner, your clothes will fuzz without fabric conditioner. Adding fabric conditioner when washing mildly aged fabrics will actually smooth out the fibers in the fabric (which helps the color appear more vibrant) and improve the appearance of the clothing.\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 3: You should wash it after every time you wear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zoe says, \"Really pay attention to the needs of your life and also to your garments. I only clean my clothes when I feel that they need it. Over-washing your clothes or washing them when they're not actually dirty is a common mistake people make.\" Items like jeans and some shirts can be worn a few times without washing if they aren't stained, but certain things like underwear and workout clothes should be washed every time you wear them. That is, of course, unless you're just wearing yoga pants to watch TV, in which case you should wash them after two to three uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 4: If you wash your clothes in the washer, they will shrink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think a misconception sometimes is shrinking,\" Rachel says. \"And in fact, typically that's actually done in the dryer, not in the washing machine.\" If the label on your clothing says you can wash it, you're totally fine doing so. Just make sure to let it air-dry instead of tumble-drying to prevent shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 5: Hanging your clothes to dry is the best way to dry them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes drying your clothes on a hanger will actually cause damage,\" Rachel says. \"On a really fragile knit, it will leave a hanger mark on it, so a lot of times I just lie them flat or I'll put them outside to dry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 6: Anything cashmere or silk must be dry-cleaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cashmere, polyester, and silk are commonly known as fabrics that should only be dry-cleaned, but these fabrics are actually fine to wash in the washer. Instances when these shouldn't be washed is if the item is made with a special dye or delicately constructed. Read the care label to be sure.\n",

      "Empire creator Lee Daniels will be making a deep pocket donation to a charity for Sean Penn as the Oscar winner pulls the plug on his $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Oscar nominee. No details of the size of the donation to Haitian relief were made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry that I have hurt you, Sean, and I apologize and retract my reckless statements about you,” Daniels said today in an apology that accompanies the donation and ends the nearly 9-month war of words and writs between the two. “How thoughtless of me. You are someone I consider a friend, a brilliant actor and true Hollywood legend and humanitarian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I accept Lee’s heartfelt apology and appreciate the sincerity with which it was delivered,” said Penn Wednesday in a statement of his own. “I also accept and appreciate his generous donation to J/P HRO, which will have a transformative effect on the lives of those we serve in Haiti.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial filing from Penn last September came not long after The Butler director in a Hollywood Reporter interview seemingly equated a double standard based on race out of the media response Empire star Terrence Howard had received from past run-ins with law and domestic violence accusations. Specifically, Daniels was nodding towards Penn’s behavior back in the 1980s, when the El Chapo interviewer was married to Madonna. He “ain’t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he’s some f*ckin’ demon,” Daniels said of Howard. “That’s a sign of the time, of race, of where we are right now in America.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Daniels addressed that matter directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I too have been the subject of false attacks by others, like those made here,” the Empire co-creator said. My most important role is as a father, and it is important to me that my children learn that it is wrong to reference gossip as fact, as I did here. That can be very damaging and hurtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Domestic violence is a very serious issue,” Daniels added. “My comments were cavalier; it was not my intention to diminish the severity of the issue, but rather to express a view regarding the disparate treatment of men of color in our national conversation. I apologize again for the distress that this has caused you and your family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In early December last year, after some wrangling over jurisdiction, Daniels tried to get the initial complaint from Penn tossed. At the time, Daniels also claimed then his comments were protected by the First Amendment. No way, replied Penn in his first amended complaint of December 17 – to which a short declaration of support from his ex-wife Madonna was attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed almost 100 years ago, the First Amendment is not absolute,” said Penn in an amended complaint filed by his attorney Mathew Rosengart of L.A.’s Greenberg Traurig. “Just as it does not protect a person from ‘shouting fire in a crowded theatre,’ it also does not protect defamatory conduct.” In her attached declaration, Madonna noted she was “aware” of reports of Penn assaulting and abusing her and called them “completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early February, Daniels sought again to get the matter dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Penn is incapable of establishing that Daniels uttered his opinion with knowledge of probable falsity, as the Challenged Statement is pre-dated by decades of spine-chilling accounts of Penn’s alleged violent abuse of his ex-wife Madonna,” claimed the February 2 filing. To further the point of the inclusion of the Material Girl backing her ex after years of rumors about abusive behavior by Penn in the relationship, Daniels’ filing asked “why neither Penn nor Madonna cried defamation and sued any of these prior publications.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, now we know someone cried “uncle” and that was that.\n"

      "\n",
      "Many PC users will have a ‘God Mode’ folder sitting on their desktop — it’s a neat Windows tweak that allows immediate access to a whole host of different controls that come in handy every now and again. However, new information from McAfee suggests that malware could be taking advantage of the same functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamer is a piece of malware that’s been around for several years, but a new version riffs on “God Mode” to hide away on your system. A few devious tricks have been used in an attempt to prevent users from getting rid of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The malware installs itself in the AppData directory, creating a registry run key value so that it can survive a reboot. However, when users click on the folder created by Dynamer during this process, they’ll simply be redirected to an unrelated area of the control panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse yet, the folder uses a ‘com4’ string in its name to gain some extra protection from Windows. This tricks the OS into treating the folder like a device, which prevents the user from deleting it as they might normally, according to a report from Extreme Tech.\n",

      "\n",
      "The recent slate of anti-LGBT legislation proposed — and passed — in some U.S. states hasn't gone unnoticed by the rest of the world. On Thursday, CNN reported that the U.K. government had added an update to its official foreign travel advice for visitors to the U.S. under the \"Local laws and customs\" section, saying \"The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country. LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The warning refers to both HB2 — the so-called bathroom bill that recently passed in North Carolina, which bans trans people from using public restrooms that are not their assigned gender, and Mississippi's \"religious freedom\" law — also recently passed, that legalizes discrimination against LGBT people if it is \"consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction,\" reports CNN.\n",

      "Gerry Broome/AP In North Carolina, an HB2 protest blocks the street.\n",

      "The anti-LGBT legislation passed in North Carolina and Mississippi have received widespread criticism from within the U.S.: Just after HB2 passed in March, North Carolina residents began tweeting out their opposition to the bill with the hashtag #WeAreNotThis. A slew of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Mumford & Sons, Ringo Starr, Ani DiFranco and Cyndi Lauper have taken a stand against the bill, either canceling their North Carolina shows or turning them into a protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other states have also responded to the bills as well — several state governors have issued executive orders banning official travel to Mississippi — but the U.K.'s newest piece of \"advice\" for LGBT travelers to the U.S. is disheartening proof that what's going on in some U.S. states reflects on the country as a whole.\n",

      "\n",
      "“How dare this guy write that ‘the only reason why an average woman over the age of 30 is still not married is because nobody wants to marry her’?” bellowed my friend. I glared at the beautiful 31-year-old media executive who is a rising star in her company—and, obviously, single.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not about whether someone wants to marry me. It’s about whether I want that man in my life. It is my choice,” she continued. “It’s Kong men who should get real and stop blaming us women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Women have long been the victims in an ongoing battle of the sexes in Hong Kong over the past three decades. Government statistics show that the number of men per 1,000 women dropped significantly from 1,087 in 1981 to 858 in 2014. A recent report revealed that last year there were over 1 million women aged 15 or above who had never been married, versus 962,700 men who hadn’t tied the knot—so technically, at least, 37,300 women are destined to remain single, and this doesn’t even factor in whether any of the 962,700 men are gay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the fearful message has spread: Hong Kong is running out of men! So ladies, if you don’t want to end up as an old maid and die alone, you must hurry and “get real.” Don’t be picky and only go after men who have a “good package.” Cure your “princess syndrome” and stop being a spoiled brat. Don’t become one of those gold-digging, delusional Kong nui (a derogatory term for Hong Kong women) or a successful career woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stigma toward single women has become the central narrative of Hong Kong’s dating culture. The message to women is clear: Lower your expectations, even though you might deserve better. A column entitled “Hey sisters, get real or you will die alone” published on April 11 in EJ Insight is the latest, most offensive iteration of this message. (Yes, this is the one that offended my friend so much. While it appears to have been removed by the publisher, perhaps because of the number of complaints, a cached version is here.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, neither men nor women want to settle for less than what they want—and Hong Kong men and Hong Kong women seem to want different things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hong Kong women have long been accused of being materialistic and eyeing money, but there is a reason for it. According to Fan Lai, a professional counselor who deals with relationship problems and family issues, few Hong Kong women are looking to marry a scion of a property tycoon. But, she added, many do aim for a man with a monthly income somewhere between HK$80,000 and HK$100,000 (roughly US$10,300 to US$12,900). That’s because they want a man who is financially independent and won’t turn around asking them for money or take advantage of them. “They are women who have a great education, a successful career, and a pretty face and just don’t want to settle for less,” Lai said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men who have a “good package” (this means, by the way, that they are physically attractive, with a sizable bank account and a promising career), she added, have complained to her that they are having greater difficulties in finding their Ms. Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They mind women who are too career-driven,” said Lai. “They don’t mind women who have a job, but when it comes to looking for a marriage partner, they want someone who is willing to stay at home and raise the family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is simply unrealistic. “How is it possible for women who are smart, ambitious, and independent to surrender their freedom and become a stay-at-home mum?” Lai questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick survey of my single female friends confirmed that they are unwilling to settle for less—and sadly Kong men are the worst to date, a conclusion that has nothing to do with their finances or physique.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kong men are not gentlemen at all,” said Lung. “If you go on a date, you pick up the girl, open the door for her, pick up the bill, and send her home. That’s very basic. And yet I’ve never seen a Kong man who has done it. But Western men do. I’m an international man eater, so I aim at a global market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-year-old university student Diana Lam described Kong men at her age as “toxic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They seem to be like ‘kidults.’ They are obsessed with video games and figurines. If a Kong man does not have a promising career or the ability to take care of a woman, Hong Kong women will not date him,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irene Fung, a 40-something businesswoman, said men who are still active in the dating market that she had encountered are usually incapable of genuine communication, have low standards for themselves, fear commitment, and lack self-confidence. “Once I dated a man who boasted how many properties he owned. It was such a turn-off,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kong men may also have little to offer in the bedroom. According to a 2014 survey released by the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong, nearly 60% of the 2,100 women aged between 21 and 40 reported at least one sexual problem that lasted over three months to one year—which could be attributed to a partners’ lack of expertise. Nearly 32% said they had no desire. A similar percentage said they had problems getting aroused. Some 40% said they fail to attain orgasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before accusing women of being unrealistic Kong nui and gold-diggers, Kong men should reflect on their shortcomings first,” Lung pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they do “settle down,” some Hong Kong men actually don’t. Fung said she has also encountered many married men who are wealthy and successful, looking for girlfriends behind the back of their wife. “They act as if they were single,” she said. “It is men who should get real and stop wasting our time. Being with a man is not a must. We’ve got better things to do.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "With 70 percent of our global real estate consisting of oceans and other bodies of water, one country with plenty of experience dealing with overcrowding is taking to the seas to build new power plants. According to new reports, China is working on floating nuclear power plants that will power its manmade chain of islands. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation has been tasked with building a fleet of these structures in order to power the various radar systems, lighthouses, airfields, and other structures that currently reside upon the new islands in the South China Sea. And predictably, it’s no small undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liu Zhengguo, an executive at the Corporation, has been quoted as saying that “demand is pretty strong” for the nuclear stations, and Chinese media reported that the government has plans to build up to 20 of these mobile plants. While the concept of floating nuclear power stations isn’t particularly new (Russia recently began building them for use in the Arctic), China’s move marks the latest in its ambitious five-year plan. As the New York Times reports, the nation currently boasts building more nuclear power stations than any other country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nuclear reactors afloat would give the Chinese military sustainable energy sources to conduct their full panoply of operations, from air early warning and defenses and offensive fire control systems to anti-submarine operations and more,” Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, told the Chicago Tribune. And more concerning, perhaps, are the potential safety risks associated with such a large undertaking. “China has already done enough damage to the maritime environment by hastily building artificial islands and destroying irreplaceable coral reefs,” Cronin continued. “We do not need a nuclear accident in these importing fishing grounds and sea lanes.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the Project, which began at the Boston Marathon one year after the 2013 bombing, was not able to garner much reciprocation for their hugs at a Donald Trump rally earlier in March.

      "No one seemed especially receptive to Nwadike. One man told him, \"I don't want any drugs,\" when Nwadike approached him for a hug. One woman threatened to punch him in the face if he did not vote for Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not feeling the love, there could be a reason — according to one rally-goer, there is no love in the world.\n",

      "MADISON, WISCONSIN—Five years ago, as part of the uprising here against Governor Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin, a group of people gathered in the rotunda of the state capitol building to sing songs of protest. Since then, those people, who became known as the Solidarity Singers, have been rousted, busted, fined $200 apiece, and subjected to the delicately named \"pain compliance\" techniques taught to capitol police forces these days. They've been targeted by silly laws—including one prohibiting the playing of musical instruments in the building—and they've beaten those laws in court. This is because the Wisconsin state constitution gives its citizens a right to assemble in their capitol even beyond that guaranteed by the federal charter. That's part of the state's legacy of progressive politics that Walker has deliberately tried to destroy, and that he's gone a long way toward wrecking already.\n",

And a testifying trombone. Motorists passing by in the street still honk their support. The songs are old, their lyrics refashioned to apply to the circumstances in Wisconsin. (For me, I'm sorry they changed \"Which Side Are You On?\" in such a way as to remove the denunciation that immortalized Harlan County sheriff J.H. Blair.) They are cheerful, happy people.

      "They need all the optimism their music can muster because, truth be told, the project that Walker launched on behalf of his patrons and in the face of massive protests in 2011 is remarkably close to completion. The project was meant to show that, with the right amount of will, big money, and political finagling, radical conservative politics could succeed even in the place where progressive politics virtually had been invented at the turn of the last century. Wisconsin is now a right-to-work state. It has a restrictive voter-suppression law. Its commitment to the relationship between the state's universities and good government—the central tenet of The Wisconsin Idea—has just about been shredded, as have the long-standing institutions dedicated to good government. The state's long-standing commitment to environmental protection has been utterly reversed. Walker—and his pet legislature—have managed to turn every part of the government into purely partisan instruments dedicated to purely partisan purposes. If Walker manages to get his protégé, Rebecca Bradley, elected to a full term on the state Supreme Court, then the takeover largely will be complete.\n",

He would tell me to take a bath and show up in the bathroom in his robe, and the sickening feeling was indescribable.\n",

      "I kept praying for a long, long, time—to a suffering child, it seemed like an eternity, but I knew God sometimes tested people’s faith. God also punished people, so I tried to remember if I had done something bad that I deserved to be punished for, but I couldn’t think of anything. Nobody had ever done anything bad enough to deserve what was happening to me.\n",

      "The only time I ever talked the monster out of hurting me was the night before Christmas Eve, and I said, “Please, no. Santa will see.” Many times he promised me he wouldn’t hurt me anymore, and I thought, maybe, that God had finally answered my prayers. But the monster always did it again, and I finally decided that God wasn’t going to help. What kind of God wouldn’t help someone like me?\n",
      "\n",
      "After a whole lot of suffering and misery, I finally figured it out: There was no God. Everybody had made a terrible mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I decided it was up to me, I told another family member what was happening and hoped that if she called the police fast, the monster wouldn’t have time to kill my mom. She called the police, and when they arrested him, he had illegal guns in his truck, and a collection of girls’ panties (they were trophies from his other victims, I learned later).\n",

      "As it turned out, he was a bigamist who had a wife in another state, so his marriage to my mom wasn’t legal. The police took custody of me that day and brought in a lady—probably a child psychologist—who interviewed me before they gave me back to my mom. When she got me back, Mom told me I was lucky they didn’t take me away for good, and she wanted to know why I didn’t tell her about the abuse instead of telling the other family member. I didn’t have an answer for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monster was violent and abusive toward her, too, but I could tell she loved him. To this day, I haven’t forgiven her for her poor judgment and I doubt I ever will.\n",

      "We lived in a small town, and everybody knew what had happened. I didn’t care because I was too young to be ashamed, and it wasn't happening anymore. I was delivered from hell, as far as I was concerned. I was blissfully happy because the monster was in jail, and my family told me they would never let him out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a trial, and I had to recount the whole story, everything that had happened, so they could record it on tape for the judge. By that time, I was six years old, but they still had to teach me the proper words for private parts so my testimony would be legal. My mom and I were both sent to court-ordered counseling. I was never told how long he would be in prison, but for years afterward, we got an annual letter from the parole board, asking if we thought he should stay in prison. The answer was always yes.\n",

      "He sent cards and letters and even a decorated T-shirt, and my mother stupidly gave these things to me. I wish she had thrown them in the trash. I think she still loved him for a long time, but she eventually married a terrific man, a friend of the family, who turned out to be a shitty husband, but he was a great father to me. He once told me he didn’t believe a word I’d said about the abuse, and that telling stories like that could ruin a man’s life. He was afraid I would tell lies about him, so he didn’t touch me at all—not a hug, not a pat on the head—and that suited me just fine. I didn’t want anybody to touch me.\n",

      "Now I am a grown woman, happily married to a wonderful man who has helped me overcome my past, with kids of my own. My mother is not part of our lives. I still have occasional flashbacks of the abuse, and I doubt I will ever get completely past it, but that misery has the capacity to consume my life. I have plenty of good memories that I choose to think about instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot understand how people think it’s a good idea to teach a helpless child that God, whose existence is entirely unproven, has the capacity to help them or save them from actual harm. I had no doubt that God was real and that he would help, and because I had faith, I suffered for a lot longer than I would have if I'd have known I was on my own. I wasted so much pain and suffering on faith. Children who have cancer and other terrible circumstances are no doubt praying, just as I did, for help that will never come. It is extraordinarily cruel to teach children to have faith, when it is possible to teach them instead to rely on themselves and on real things.\n",

Some religious people might be interested in helping me find God again, and to them, I would say, “Fuck off. You’ve done enough damage already.”\n",
      "Virginia Rep. Don Beyer Had Dinner With Undocumented Immigrants and Here's What Happened\n",
      "It's usually not polite to talk about politics at the dinner table, but there are exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the dinner shared between Virginia Rep. Don Beyer and the Pintos, a Latino family of five who live in Virginia. The Pintos were very clear in their message to Beyer: If immigration authorities were to deport undocumented members of their family, the only family member left in America would be 8-year-old Christian, who was born in Arlington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights sponsored the dinner, which consisted of the Pintos entire family: father and construction worker, Jerry Pinto Sr.; mother Elvira Pinto, who hopes to be a flight attendant; daughter Ambar Pinto, a college student and aspiring immigration lawyer; and sons Christian and Jerry. The family moved to Fairfax after their Arlington house burned down in a fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to ThinkProgress, who attended the dinner, while there was a lot of light conversation — youngest Christian spoke about hoverboards and video games — Pinto Sr. eventually brought up how he lives in fear of being reported to immigration officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's gotta be hard for you because you're hiding all the time,\" Beyer said to Jerry, ThinkProgress reported. \"That's a long time for you to be in legal limbo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal limbo Beyer referenced is the current challenge to Obama's executive actions on immigration. If the U.S. implemented Obama's executive actions, immigrants in America would be eligible for deportation deferral, work permits and state driver's licenses. But right now, the action is held up in the case United States v. Texas, which the Supreme Court will begin to hear oral arguments for on April 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my parents were in deportation proceedings, my family would completely break apart,\" a teary-eyed Ambar Pinto told ThinkProgress. \"If it was my dad, I would be the one responsible to sustain my family because my mom doesn't have access to a driver's license and she works from time to time. I don't know what would happen to my brothers. It's important that we have DAPA so that my parents won't be deported for at least two years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the saddest moment in the dinner came when youngest son Christian commented on what would happen if Donald Trump were to be elected president.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Donald Trump wins, I'm glad I have a passport,\" Christian said, referencing the trips he'd have to make to visit his family. Around 5.3 million children in the U.S. have a parent who is an undocumented immigrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Beyer, Christian and other children of undocumented immigrants are \"indistinguishable from my children, my nieces and nephews who were born in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For Beyer, the dinner was less a persuasive tool (the Congressman already supports immigration reform) but a model for many of his anti-immigrant colleagues to use as a way to interact with immigrant families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would say that they just don't understand the problem,\" Beyer said to ThinkProgress. \"It shows no compassion at all. As with this family, the youngest is a U.S. citizen born here. Another one has deferred action status. The parents have no papers. And yet we don't want to break them into three or four different pieces, or even two pieces.\"\n"

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve known for a while now that HDR was coming to Netflix sometime this year, but it seems that moment has slipped in quietly, like a stealthy teenager after a long night of partying. Owners of TVs from multiple brands have begun to notice that they can already watch Netflix content in HDR – for one specific show, that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Stream your favorite TV shows and movies with Amazon Fire TV\n",
      "\n",
      "The first season of the Netflix original series Marco Polo has been available in HDR for days, as was first spotted by FlatpanelsHD. Netflix has yet to officially announce the new capability, but has confirmed to Digital Trends that HDR, which is often referred to as the secret sauce that makes 4K content all the more brilliant, is indeed live and ready to stream on its historical drama and will soon make its appearance on other titles as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As of mid-March, we have been providing both Dolby Vision and HDR10 streams to supported TVs, giving Netflix members an even more visually stunning experience,” a Netflix representative told Digital Trends. “Marco Polo Season 1 is available now, with more titles — including Marvel’s Daredevil — coming soon.” It should be easy enough to find new content when it’s added, since the Ultra HD 4K badge will apparently be replaced with a simple HDR badge on supported series to help them stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix says that since every 4K Ultra HD TV released in 2016 from a major manufacturer will be compatible with either Dolby Vision or HDR10, it’s only a matter of time until its HDR streams are available en masse. Vizio and LG currently have Dolby Vision enabled, while TVs from other companies like Sony either provide HDR10 out of the gate, or can be updated with support, as that company’s 2015 models received last fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marco Polo may seem an odd choice as it’s not exactly one of Netflix’s hottest titles, but the high-budget period drama was shot natively in HDR, and Netflix says it had “great enthusiasm from the creative team” making it an easy first choice. Season two of the show will also be available with HDR support fairly soon, with the official release slated for June of this year. Netflix has yet to disclose when other titles such as Daredevil will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the current hype around televisions focuses on 4K resolution, but as far as Netflix is concerned, HDR is much more important. “I think HDR is more visibly different than 4K,” Netflix chief product office Neil Hunt told Digital Trends in February. “Over the past 15 years, we have had plenty of increments of pixels on the screen, and from what we saw with digital cameras, pixel count eventually stopped being interesting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix isn’t alone in the HDR game — Amazon has been showing originals like Mozart in the Jungle and Red Oaks in HDR since June of 2015. Our experience with Amazon’s version so far has been a mixed bag. Artifacts, possibly due to compression (or simply the limitations of high-speed internet at present), make it hard to fully appreciate the richer contrast and wider color gamut HDR can offer. We’re hoping the Netflix version can improve on the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, while HDR support’s arrival in more TVs means that more content will start to be shot for HDR from the beginning, it’s going to be a slower process for older shows and movies. Hunt compares adding HDR to older content to colorizing a black and white movie — a lot of effort is needed, but it may still be worth it for a grander picture in the end. Until then, for those who already own or are thinking about purchasing a new 4K Ultra HD TV with HDR support, it may be time to give Marco Polo a shot.\n",

      "What's so gripping? Well, start with a a 6K Red Dragon digital cinema camera and a $40,000 Canon camera lens. Then throw in the arctic forests of northern Sweden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saab is releasing a new Gripen, which they've deemed \"The Smart Fighter,\" on May 18th. Although the Gripen is not being sold like a Saab car, creating a video born to go viral sends a message that Saab Defence thinks they've created a plane that will grab eyeballs in defense departments worldwide. (They've got a history of pushing hard: in 1999, the company was investigated after accusations of bribery in South Africa—which ended up buying 26 Gripens.)\n",
      "\n",
      "With the new Gripens, Saab has created remarkable machines. The new Gripen D, a two seater, has a combat turnaround time of ten minutes and a total load capacity of over 11,000 pounds. The company already has long ties in Austria and Brazil, and has only worked at deepening those connections. 350 Brazilians moved to Sweden for the project, which has been documented in a web series produced by Saab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gripen has been in development for nearly 30 years. Two non-fatal crashes in 1987 and 1993 and a far-left party reluctant to spend on its military meant its funding has been passed by narrow margins in the Swedish parliament. Despite that, the Gripen is a remarkable machine: light and maneuverable, with massive lift thanks to its delta wings and a canard (the short forewing) control system allowing it to hit angles of attack at 70 to 80 degrees. It also has an open-source, fully programmable and integrated avionics system, giving it a bit more flexibility for export nations to alter the aircraft as they see it. Whether they will be able to make a dent in a global market dominated by F-16s, F-18s, and the Russian-built Su-27 Flanker is a more difficult question. Regardless,even if they stay niche Saab has already proven that they can win the war on social media. This video is gorgeous.\n",

      "The Supreme Court Just Did Something the Supreme Court Shouldn't Have to Do\n",
      "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court did a thing that my every instinct tells me that the Supreme Court shouldn't have to do. But apparently, the United States, a country with a Bill of Rights that you can buy at the gift shoppe on your way out, needed clarification on the subject of whether or not you can pauperize a criminal defendant as a way of making sure this person's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a sad and tattered joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The crucial point, Justice Breyer wrote, was that the right to counsel is a fundamental constitutional guarantee, while the government's interest in recovering money is merely important. \"Despite their importance, compared to the right to counsel of choice, these interests would seem to lie somewhat further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "This takes the pruning shears to a lot of the fig leaves prosecutors have used to cover some really shifty practices, particularly in drug cases. In addition, it's a none-too-subtle whack at the whole system of asset forfeiture which has been rife with corruption at the local and federal level for years. As Breyer also wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"…relevant legal tradition offers virtually no significant support for the Government's position. Rather, tradition argues to the contrary. Describing the 18th century English legal world (which recognized only a limited right to counsel), Blackstone wrote that \"only\" those \"goods and chattels\" that \"a man has at the time of conviction shall be forfeited.\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 388 (1765) (emphasis added); see 1 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 737 (1816) (\"[T]he party indicted may sell any of [his property]...to assist him in preparing for his defense on the trial\"). Describing the common law as understood in 19th century America (which recognized a broader right to counsel), Justice Story wrote: \"It is well known, that at the common law, in many cases of felonies, the party forfeited his goods and chattels to the crown. The forfeiture...was a part, or at least a consequence, of the judgment of conviction. It is plain from this statement, that no right to the goods and chattels of the felon could be acquired by the crown by the mere commission of the offense; but the right attached only by the conviction of the offender...In the contemplation of the common law, the offender's right was not divested until the conviction.\"\n",

      "And, while the plaintiff in this case clearly did not need to avail herself of our cash-strapped public-defender programs, this decision has ramifications there as well. In his opinion, Justice Breyer argued that impoverishing the plaintiff—essentially, forcing her to rely on the public-defender systems—was a Sixth Amendment violation in and of itself. It's not a huge leap from there to the position that underfunding those systems also violates that same amendment. As it happens, in his dissent, Anthony Kennedy, ol' Weathervane himself, made precisely that point.\n",

      "It is getting a little bit unseemly to hear Democratic analysts and liberal voices in the punditariat latching on one of the more desperate hopes of Republicans who would rather not run against Hillary Rodham Clinton—namely, that she's going to be questioned by the FBI and subsequently indicted for something in connection with the great email nothingburger. Today's entrant is the increasingly hilarious H.A. Goodman, whose devotion to the notion that The Great Bernie Wave Is Just Around The Corner has become positively Millerite in its fervor. (Scott at Lawyers, Guns, and Money is H.A.'s most diligent chronicler.) Anyway, on Wednesday, after Sanders won a substantial victory at the polls in Wisconsin, and a considerably less substantial one as far as the delegate count goes, H.A. pronounced his heart lightened by the prospect of HRC getting tangled up with the Feds.\n",

      "\n",
      "Before we get into the nub of the gist here, let's take a look at Mr. Sievert's author's note at the end of the column.\n",

      "Well, alright then. But he did work in the DOJ under both Republicans and Democrats, and he seems to be more of a national security fetishist than anything else—so we'll give him a pass for the moment as regards his present gig. What Sievert is arguing is that HRC could still be indicted even if the information found in her emails was never classified at all, or classified ex post facto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The applicable statute, 18 USC793, however, does not even once mention the word \"classified.\" The focus is on \"information respecting the national defense\" that potentially \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.\" 793 (f) specifically makes it a crime for anyone \"entrusted with … any document ... or information relating to the national defense … through gross negligence (to permit) the same to be removed from its proper place of custody.\" A jury (not a Democrat or Republican political administration) is, of course, the best body to determine gross negligence on the facts of this case.\n",

      "If Mr. Sievert and our buddy H.A. think that the current Department of Justice is going to indict the frontrunner for the Democratic—see, Ronald? it's easy when you try—presidential nomination based on a semantic quibble in the applicable statute, they've both been sampling their own product much too often. (Sievert pretty much admits this is the case by the end of his column, although he finds the whole thing deplorable.) Honestly, HRC raised $29 million in March and she's coming into a couple of wheelhouse primaries, and she's still ahead anyway. My world should collapse so handsomely.\n",

      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Unnamed sources in the upstream supply chain are chatting away about the upcoming MacBooks from Apple, saying that Taiwan component makers are seeing increased competition from rivals located overseas that are supplying parts for the new devices. For instance, Amphenol, a hinge maker located in the United States, has joined Apple’s supply chain to serve up this specific part, taking business away from Jarllytec and Shin Zu Shing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news arrives by way of DigiTimes, which reports that Apple’s new MacBooks won’t appear until the second half of 2016. Amphenol is reportedly creating hinges through a special metal injection molding process to help the MacBooks achieve an ultra-thin form factor. This is the same company that provides hinges for Microsoft’s Surface Pro line of products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources have also told DigiTimes that battery pack suppliers Simplo Technology and Dynapack International Technology, both of which are located in Taiwan, are facing competition from China-based Desay and Sunwoda Electronics. The two Chinese companies provide batteries for Apple’s iPhone devices, and have submitted MacBook battery packs for testing. So far Apple has not placed MacBook battery orders with the two Chinese companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "DigiTimes originally reported back in March that Apple would start shipping 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks at the end of the second quarter of 2016. These two models will supposedly be thinner than the existing MacBook Air while sharing a design similar to current 12-inch Retina MacBooks. Unnamed sources added that notebook makers Asus, Dell, and Lenovo are also launching ultra-thin solutions in the same time frame to compete with Apple’s new lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "9to5Mac adds to the MacBook rumor mill, reporting that the new devices will likely only feature USB Type-C ports on both sides to keep the super-slim form factor. They also may arrive in gold and rose gold color options, making them super attractive in addition to being highly thin. Branding is uncertain for now, as they could replace the current MacBook Pros or be released as larger versions of the Retina MacBook.\n",
      "\n",
      "A previous report supplied by Economic Daily News back in November 2015 claimed that the new MacBook Air would be a major upgrade from the current model, featuring Internet component changes and a thinner, lighter design. Apple is also supposedly pondering 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the MacBook Air, and could very well ditch the 11-inch model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report went on to claim that the next-generation MacBook Air would sport new cooling modules, a new chassis, new batteries, and so on. Apple will reportedly stay with the same supply chain manufacturers, including Quanta, although the new DigiTimes report says otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "DigiTimes previously said that Apple shipped 20.38 million Mac-based products during 2015, representing solid growth over 2014’s sales numbers. The site quoted sources saying that despite a “weakening” demand for notebooks, Apple should see increased growth in that sector during 2016 thanks to the updated MacBook and MacBook Air solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new MacBook and MacBook Air devices are expected to be revealed during WWDC 2016 this June, and will likely start shipping units in the second half of 2016 as DigiTimes’ sources indicated. That could very well mean July, so you may not need to wait too long to upgrade your current MacBook or MacBook Air. Of course, given that everything mentioned here is pure rumor, we’ll just have to wait and see what WWDC 2016 has in store for Apple customers.\n",

      "How Olivia Munn Got In Shape for X-Men\n",
      "In X-Men: Apocalypse, out May 27, Olivia Munn joins the Marvel world as Psylocke, a character who uses telekinesis to strike with superhuman strength. To get in fighting shape—and fit in a risqué latex body suit she's admitted needing lube to get into—the actress turned to husband-wife duo Karine Lemieux and Ken Tran of martial arts-focused DAX Gym in Montreal. Ahead, five things Munn did over five months to lose 12 pounds and transform her body:\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "1. She made training a (second) full-time job\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If she wasn't shooting, she was at the gym. No question,\" Lemieux says, adding that Munn trained for six or seven hours daily. On top of filming. Lemieux trained Munn—who happens to have a black belt in tae kwon do, which she earned as a teen—using mainly body-weight exercises: punching, kicking, and other techniques from boxing and tae kwon do. \"I tried to make it fun every day—she doesn't like a typical workout,\" the trainer says. Good thing he made it fun, because as Lemieux says, \"I think she was at the gym more often than in her apartment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. She took sword fighting seriously\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hours of training alone were spent perfecting sword work with Tran, who says Munn did 95 percent of her own stunts in the movie. She toned her arms with drills in striking, chopping, stabbing, blocking, and twirling. Tran was impressed in her investment in learning not only necessary choreography, but the whole art of sword fighting. \"That's the type of person she is. She's not going to do it superficially,\" Tran says of Munn. \"She picks up really fast and she works really hard, so we went up levels very fast.\" Observe:\n",

      "Even Ryan Reynolds, aka Deadpool, couldn't compete.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. She skipped basic butt exercises\n",
      "\n",
      "You'd never see Munn doing \"boring\" exercises like squats in the gym. Lemieux emphasized more creative methods. They favored working on kicking techniques. One move they did almost daily to work the the butt, quads, and hips: stand facing outward from a wall, point your toe to the wall and do 10 kicks in the air with one leg, hold it midair for 10 seconds, do 10 kicks with the same leg, repeat two or three times. \"[Olivia] always goes for the tough workouts—she knows it's going to be hard, but she likes it that way,\" Lemieux says. \"We made it different every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. She ate 80% raw\n",
      "\n",
      "As for diet, Lemieux says she had Munn do an 80 percent raw diet, 20 percent anything else. Additionally, before she would head to training in the morning, Munn would eat only fruit, either on its own or in smoothie form. \"She tried to eat as many fruits and veggies as possible. She cut down on complex carbs, and I told her to eat more quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes, and wild rice instead of white rice,\" Lemieux says. Munn also had to cut down on bread and limited her meat intake, focusing more on getting protein in seeds and nuts. \"She just wanted to put everything on her side. She was already disciplined for that as well,\" the trainer says.\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The 20 percent at least afforded Munn the freedom to eat things like Cheetos:\n",
      "\n",
      "4. She got way more creative than crunches\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all the core work she would do while running through boxing combinations, Munn trained her core by doing atypical movements. Lemieux would have her get in a plank position with her feet on a ball, and then she'd have to use her abs to bring them in (and she would do it sideways too). Another abs move Munn did was wrap her feet around a punching bag while in plank position and holding it. If ever there were sit-ups, she would be wearing boxing gloves and punching as she came up.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. She paid close attention to stretching\n",
      "\n",
      "An often neglected part of training, stretching was paramount for Munn in Lemieux's training program. \"She was pretty flexible already, but we really focused on a lot of deep stretching to get those high kicks,\" the trainer says, adding that they did plenty of yoga-inspired stretches. One move they did was to have her back against the floor, her legs up on the wall and splitting the legs apart for one minute, continually pushing down further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",

      "Van Kuilenberg attended the rally to \"represent the LGBT youth who are hurt by his propaganda and rhetoric.\" Prior to entering the event, Van Kuilenberg stood outside with a sign that read \"Human rights are not up for debate.\" Kuilenberg said he left the sign outside before entering the event space.\n",

      "Police on horseback and riot gear were called in to disperse a crowd that gathered in the streets in front of the OC Fair & Event Center, where Trump was speaking. CNN reports that several protesters smashed police cars and at least one Donald Trump supporter was punched among the chaos. Many demonstrators held up Mexican flags to protest Trump's immigration policy, which includes the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants and building a wall at the Mexican border. According to a tweet from the Orange County Sheriff's Department last night, about 20 people were arrested and the crowd was dispersed by 11 p.m., three hours after Trump's rally ended:\n",

Trump, a polarizing figure who has openly insulted women and immigrants, has encouraged violence at his rallies in previous statements and in March said he would pay the legal fees of any supporter who'd \"knock the crap out\" of agitated protesters.\n",

      "Elon Musk Wants SpaceX To Build A City On Mars\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Tired of your time on Earth? Elon Musk may have a solution. The ambitious SpaceX founder and CEO is known for his — literally — out-of-this-world ideas, and the latest is a city on Mars. In a surprise appearance at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center last week, the entrepreneur laid bare his plans to colonize the Red Planet. Well, not completely. Rather, Musk teased the existence of a full-blown plan, which he will elucidate upon further in September, when he gives a much-anticipated talk at the International Aeronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Musk’s initial topic of discussion centered around rockets and his Falcon 9, things took an interesting turn toward the end of his press conference, during which he spoke about the possibility of a SpaceX “City on Mars.” Musk is known for being well ahead of the curve when it comes to many of his concepts, a point he referenced during the discussion. “I think it’s going to sound pretty crazy,” Musk told the audience. “So it should be at least entertaining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To many, Mars seems like the next logical frontier — a new sort of Manifest Destiny for earthlings to conquer. “It’s a fundamental decision we have to make as a civilization,” Musk recently told a reporter in Hong Kong. “Mars is the next, natural step. In fact, it’s the only planet we really have a shot at establishing a self-sustaining city on.” That said, this is all mostly talk — at least until September.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as far as how we’re going to get to Mars, Musk certainly seems to have figured it out. Reusable rockets, the executive says, are the key to future space travel. Calling reusability the “fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space,” Musk has certainly proven the viability of his designs. He’s met with quite a bit of success in his latest rocket launches and landings, and with a track record like his, a city on Mars may not be that crazy of an idea after all.\n",
      "Are Aliens Real? If They Are, Science Says They Won’t Look Like What You Expect\n",
      "Will humanity one day find kindred brethren among the stars? It makes for good books and movies, and recent scientific discoveries have suggested planets in the same habitable range of conditions as Earth may be surprisingly common.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if life has risen on other planets, the differences between Homo sapiens and our new, otherworldly friends are likely to be greater than Star Trek would have you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't have humanoid biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old sci-fi trope aliens will look a lot like humans, except with some casually rearranged features to make them look exotic, has no basis in science. While the phenomenon of convergent evolution has resulted in many Earth species developing similar traits (such as flight) independently, those features evolved under similar terrestrial and evolutionary conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wild-eyed tales of little green men have entertained humans for generations. But the only plausible theory for a truly humanoid alien presence in the galaxy might be panspermia, a theory in which some creator either deliberately seeded life on different planets or microbes spread around the universe on space junk. Otherwise, the odds that of all the infinite forms alien life could take, it would mirror humanity, are very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't look much like Earth life at all, actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unique properties of carbon, which forms double bonds with other carbon atoms \"naturally and easily\" compared to other elements like silicon, form the basis of all organic chemistry, Scientific American wrote. \"Carbon is the main component of sugars, proteins, fats, DNA, muscle tissue, pretty much everything in your body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But life forms with alternate biochemistries based on elements like silicon could evolve on different planetary conditions. Though water is by far the most common and suitable organic solvent available for life on other planets, it's also possible other compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen sulfide could fill the role. Change any of the building blocks common to life on Earth — or simply change any of the local conditions in which those building blocks are assembled — and the odds other living worlds will much resemble ours fades significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Massachusetts Institute of Technology planetary scientist Sara Seager, along with colleagues William Bains and Renyu Hu, built models intended to detect exoplanets where atmospheric gases are out of equilibrium, thus suggesting biological or mechanical interference in its natural chemistry, New Scientist reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \"On planets with atmospheres dominated by hydrogen, the model predicts that methyl chloride, dimethyl sulfide and nitrous oxide could indicate the presence of life: Plausible amounts of alien life at the surface could produce them in quantities that are detectable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Life on these planets might have radically different biological plans, from radial instead of bilateral symmetry to only having one cell. Anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might not want to communicate with us, or destroy us, or even have the desire or ability to do either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alien ambassadors welcoming the Earth into a galactic union, or alternately alien soldiers leveling entire cities using war machines brimming with plasma weaponry, are common fixtures in fiction. But even assuming any alien life humanity discovers out in the universe is complex and intelligent, that intelligence may be so thoroughly alien as to make meaningful interaction unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, given humanity's proven track record of violence, war and mayhem, and our remarkable adaptiveness to a range of conditions, it's possible other species might view us as a threat worth avoiding at all costs, as joked in the video above.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also impossible to predict whether an alien psychology, having little in common with our own, would view interspecies contact as more than a curiosity. Physiological and cultural differences may pose an insurmountable difficulty.\n",

      "\"There are plenty of creatures here on Earth that are so astoundingly different from us that we can barely comprehend them,\" sci-fi author Aaron Rosenberg told Popular Mechanics. \"Try watching an octopus pull itself through a tiny crack in a glass tank sometime, or examine a tobacco hornworm, or look at a praying mantis up close. A real alien would be so far from anything we've ever imagined that we would barely be able to comprehend its existence. And we would seem just as completely, bafflingly bizarre to it.\"\n"

      "\"I messed up,\" Baskett said. \"I put myself in a bad situation. And everything through me brought pain upon this family.\"\n",

      "Hexlox are a little magnetic nubbins that lock inside standard Hex or Allen bolts, blocking wrenches and making the bolt impossible to turn. Hexlox come in a variety of sizes, and open and close using a unique magnetic key. They come in a variety of sizes to fit any bolt on your bike, allowing you to “lock” things that are usually hard to secure, like your bars or even your dropout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: See here for the latest bikes on the market\n",
      "\n",
      "Other security systems usually involve replacing the bolt itself, or using some sort of cable-tie method that can be defeated by a determined thief. Hexlox don’t require swapping any parts except for quick-release skewers — but more on that later. Pick the Hexlox up with the key, put it in the bolt, give it a quarter turn, and that’s it. The bolt is locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leave it on until you need to swap something. Made of 316 Stainless Steel, Hexlox are weatherproof, so they won’t rust in place. Adding Hexlox to pre-existing bolts means no worrying about thieves cannibalizing parts of your bike, and no carrying extra cables to secure your saddle or wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "These even let you secure your headset, stem, and bars, which is otherwise tricky to do. One older technique was like a basic concept for Hexlox: ball bearings superglued into a bolt (superglue can easily be dissolved with acetone). Obviously Hexlox can’t be flicked out of their bolt the way a determined thief could do to something that’s only glued down. Hexlox literally lock, and the key is unique, so you don’t have to worry that another Hexlox owner might turn thief on you and grab your gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only catch here is that they obviously don’t work on quick release skewers (which have a lever at one end rather than an Allen wrench slot). The Hexlox Company designed a set of hex skewers that they are offering as part of some reward bundles, but if you already have a set of hex skewers for your wheels and saddle, they’ll work just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hexlox smashed its modest funding goal of a little over $22,300, so people must see the benefit: They’re unobtrusive, cost-conscious security for your bike, and revolutionary as far as fork and headset security is concerned. The campaign had a $100,000 stretch goal for colored caps for the wheel skewers, so they will hopefully be added to options for everyone else after June 2016 when they ship to backers.\n"

      "Air France Hits More Turbulence Over Flights to Iran\n",
      "\n",
      "Air France won’t resume flights to Tehran until April 17, but airline staff are already worried about what they will face after landing in Iran. Last week, female airline attendants argued they shouldn’t be forced to cover their hair while in the Islamic Republic, as required by law. Air France navigated that blip by agreeing to let female staffers who refused to cover skip those flights. Now, a gay Air France steward is demanding a similar diversion for fear of being persecuted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gay sex is punishable by death in Iran, and a flight attendant who identified himself only as Laurent M. launched a petition asking that homosexual crew members not be ordered to fly there. By Tuesday, the petition had more than 2,000 signatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, our sexuality isn’t written on our passports and it doesn’t change the way we work as a crew,” Laurent wrote. “But it is inconceivable to force someone to go to a country where his kind are condemned for who they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Homosexuality is considered a crime in some 75 countries — close to half the world. But Laurent asked Air France to give crew members the right to refuse to fly to places where they could be killed for being gay — a smaller list that includes Iran and other destinations like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Mauritania.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an emailed statement to Foreign Policy, Air France said it has “not had any issues in recent years” in the 17 countries it directly serves that also have restrictive laws against homosexuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By its nature, flight crews’ work requires them to serve countries whose cultures and regulations are very different to our own, and Air France management carries out constant monitoring to ensure that all members of its flight crews can perform their duties in the safest possible conditions,” the statement read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran holds the world record for most executions per capita, but mostly for drug convictions; the number of people killed for being gay is unknown. Some in Iran’s gay community say the state has been far more lenient since President Hassan Rouhani’s election in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air France debacle is the latest in a series of cultural clashes between secular France and Islamic Iran that have served as stumbling blocks in the two countries’ fledgling relationship. In January, a lunch between Rouhani and French President Francois Hollande was canceled when Hollande insisted he wanted to drink wine at the table, and his Iranian counterpart said he would not show up if wine was served.\n",

      "The Obama administration is likely on the brink of releasing a secret report from a congressional inquiry into 9/11, and the information contained in its pages could link the Saudi government to the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The classified 28-page chapter has been sequestered to a basement vault in the Capitol building ever since George W. Bush deemed it a potential intelligence threat in 2002, but sources who have read the report say that protecting United States-Saudi Arabia relations was what was really at stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 19 Al Qaeda hijackers implicated in the Sept. 11 attacks, 15 were Saudi citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saudi government has long denied allegations that it was complicit in funding extremists, and has even encouraged the U.S. government to release the documents so that it can address any specific allegations levied against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Tim Roemer, a member of the congressional inquiry who said he had read the chapter in question three times, described its contents as a \"preliminary police report\".\n",

      "\"There were clues. There were allegations. There were witness reports. There was evidence about the hijackers, about people they met with — all kinds of different things that the 9/11 Commission was then tasked with reviewing and investigating,\" Roehmer said, according to the Associated Press.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Rhodes, a White House official, told CNN that Obama had ordered the papers to be reviewed for potential declassification.

      "Tesla Model 3 Could Get a HUD Dashboard\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "While the hundreds of thousands of people who put down deposits have apparently seen enough, the Tesla Model 3 prototypes unveiled a few weeks ago do not represent 100 percent of what we’ll see on the production car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said there are still some things left to be revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of those things likely pertain to the interior. The Model 3 prototypes had no instrumentation, save for one large landscape screen, which raised a few eyebrows. But what if that screen was just a placeholder for a comprehensive head-up display? Boy Genius Report believes that could be the case, mainly because of one recent Tesla hire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of Milan Kovac is an indication that Tesla is pursuing sophisticated HUD tech, the report claims. Kovac is the former principal engineer of Skully Systems, which developed a motorcycle helmet with an integrated HUD. Kovac also worked at Softkinetic, the Belgian company that developed gesture-control technology currently used in the BMW 7 Series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could a gesture-controlled HUD dashboard be the next piece of the Model 3 puzzle? A dashboard with essentially no physical instrumentation or switches would be an impressive technical achievement for any car, let alone one with a base price of $35,000. Whether this theory turns out to be true or not, we know the interior shown in the Model 3 prototypes is not what customers will get when production starts at the end of 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent Elon Musk Twitter chatter indicates the Model 3 interior shown at the end of March isn’t the real one, says Jalopnik. In one tweet, Musk said the setup shown in the prototypes is “not the real steering system,” while in another he promised that the “real steering controls” will be “like a spaceship.” When asked flat out why the Model 3 appears to have display screen instead of a traditional gauge cluster, Musk said it will “make sense after part two” of the Model 3 reveal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model 3 is one of the most anticipated new-car launches in recent memory, and Tesla wants to milk it for all it’s worth. Given Tesla’s past achievements, it’s not inconceivable that the Model 3 will get some kind of radical dashboard design. What’s still more surprising is that around 400,000 people were willing to put down $1,000 deposits having barely seen the car.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite a diverse lineup of nominees for the 2016 Tony Awards, including nominations for The Color Purple stars Cynthia Erivo and Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Hudson didn't receive recognition for her role in the same show. Her response to the snub was shockingly honest, if not brutally so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to a Twitter user's frustration with the snub, Hudson explained in a since-deleted tweet her theory that she was brought on to the show for her \"celebrity\" versus her \"talent.\" She then said she was \"not surprised\" by the Tony nominating committee's decision.\n",

      "\"Athleisure\" might've just been added to the dictionary, but some universities aren't ready to embrace the Lululemon strappy tank top trend just yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the case for Danielle, a student at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, who was kicked out of the school's fitness center for inappropriate attire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was she wearing a see-through top? Pasties? This underboob bra? Nope. This is what she was wearing when the incident occurred:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your shirt is cut too low in the back,\" a student employee told Danielle, as recounted in an interview with Total Sorority Move. \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Confused because this is exactly what many girls are wearing in gyms (and to the mall... and to class... and to pretty much everywhere else) across the country? Danielle was a little thrown off as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to her, the private school's fitness center dress code states \"all users must wear proper fitness attire.\" The following details are available on the university's website, as well as in an explanatory PDF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Washington & Lee\n",
      "\n",
      "The school does not allow \"sleeveless shirts with the arm holes or gaps open below the bottom of the shoulder blades\" or \"shirts that expose parts of the abdominal area, rib cage, and/or the lower back, front or sides of the torso. (For the purposes of this policy the lower back is the area below a horizontal line under the shoulder blades.)\" Because, rib cages are dangerous, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danielle was not without a sense of humor about the ridiculousness of her ejection. In her (sarcastic) words, \"the whopping four boys in the fitness center could safely enjoy their workouts without stumbling upon the erotica that was displayed in the form of a keyhole on my top.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The school is defending their archaic protocol. The school's website states the dress code was put into place for the \"health and safety of all users,\" to \"[prevent] skin infections and to preserve the longterm life of the equipment.\" Two completely different ideas here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since conversation has started on social media, the school has posted a statement on its website from the Director of Athletics stating, \"We want to assure the W&L community that the policy applies equally to men and women.\" Sure. Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got some questions here: Wasn't Danielle's tank designed specifically for the gym? Who is she even putting in danger by wearing a cut-out top? Herself? She's an adult, can't she take that risk on her own? Perhaps the fitness director just really, really hates Lululemon?\n",
      "\n",
      "They aren't the only school with a strict dress code. Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, requires students to cover their shoulders. The school said the policy was put in place for safety reasons, similar to what Washington and Lee said, as there is a risk of MRSA and other staph infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "These aren't two isolated instances. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee also has a rule in place that states shirts must \"fully [cover] the back, shoulders, chest, stomach and sides.\" While the school stated health concerns as one reason for the rule, it also cited this: \"Muscle-bound men in cut-off shirts might deter freshmen from working out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(Ah yes, the old muscle-bound-men-in-cut-off-shirts-are-too-intimidating-to-work-out-near excuse.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Want to ban tank tops for health reasons? Fine. But if these schools are using safety as an excuse to ban clothing to avoid \"distraction,\" and/or discriminating against one sex, than this is a case of schools unnecessarily policing their students' wardrobes.\n",

      "President Obama Just Got Black Lives Matter Completely Wrong\n",
      "One of President Barack Obama's formative political experiences was working as a community organizer as a young man in Chicago. But you may not have guessed it based on his puzzling criticism of Black Lives Matter activists for \"yelling\" too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a youth town hall Sunday in London, MSNBC reports that Obama expressed sympathy for the grievances of the criminal justice reform movement, but was skeptical of their tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't just keep on yelling at them and you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" Obama said, per MSNBC. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable — that can institutionalize the changes you seek and to engage the other side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why Bill Clinton Just Tripped Up Hillary in the Worst Way Possible\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama said he felt the Black Lives Matter movement was falling prey to a problem that afflicts all too many activists — an inability to translate advocacy into concrete programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too often what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately ... that they never take that next step and say, 'Well now I have to sit down and try to actually get something done?'\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem: Obama's sentiment that activists can be better at agitating than execution is fair as a general concern, but in the case of Black Lives Matter it misses the mark by quite a wide margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, Black Lives Matter did very rapidly form a wing that engaged institutional politics. In the last year, activists from the movement have met with officials at the White House and Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Movement members have launched multiple Black Lives Matter political action committees to support political candidates who take up their banner (although they've had a slow start). And some activists met with liberal megadonors at the Democracy Alliance's annual gathering in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "Activist meetings with political movers and shakers have entailed the discussion of a wide range of issues, but there's evidence that they've had a real focus. Campaign Zero, which has figured prominently in high-level discussions, has laid out a very specific vision of police reforms required to reverse trends of police violence and overzealous arrest rates in communities of color. And when Democrats have discussed things like a \"new New Deal\" that invests funds in low-resource minority neighborhoods, it's precisely because activists have pushed them to use that language.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is Obama talking about? He may just be venting about the pressure that the Clintons — who occupy the same space in establishment Democratic politics that he does — have been experiencing in recent months from activists at speaking events. Hillary Clinton was called out in February for her 1996 reference to certain young black criminals as \"super predators,\" and Bill Clinton was disrupted during a speech earlier in April over the 1994 crime bill. Perhaps in Obama's eyes, those kinds of actions have been overly shrill and a distraction from the kind of mature and sober meetings that activists should be having behind closed doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that complaint is weak as well. Those confrontations have spurred serious public conversations about the past that matter in the present. Talking about the dehumanizing language that politicians on both sides of the aisle used toward black youth in the '90s has been important for contextualizing the kinds of anti-crime policies that were pursued at the time. And scrutinizing the Clintons' support for tough-on-crime policies from that time is an effective way to push them to be better on the issues, as well as create a bigger mandate for more sweeping reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reality is that successful social movements need both strident advocacy and an ability to engage in deal-making. Both those impulses complement each other by shifting the conversation, and then translating that conversation into action. Given that most reforms that are being considered in Washington at the moment offer fairly weak corrections to a deeply flawed criminal justice system, there isn't a strong case for activists to be yelling any less. In fact, given that political reform always hinges on momentum, they should probably be yelling more.\n"

      "PlayStation Vue Exit Survey Could Shape Its Future\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, Sony’s PlayStation Vue Internet TV streaming service finally became available nationwide — something cord-cutters located outside of a handful of major metropolitan areas had been anxiously awaiting since the service’s introduction last year. While the service is now available to all, it’s still got a long way to go, and now it seems we might have an idea as to where it is headed next.\n",
      "\n",
      "PlayStation Vue customers trying to cancel their subscription are presented with a survey asking what might change their mind, and this survey was recently shared on Reddit, and spotted by Exstreamist. Some of the options are commonly seen on exit surveys, but others could point to planned additions to the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, customers are asked if lowering the subscription price by $5, $10, or $15 dollars would be enough to change their mind. The service currently starts at either $30 or $40 per month, depending on whether or not the customer is located in an area where local channels are offered. The lower-priced Core Slim package was introduced last month when the service expanded nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more interesting questions come in the form of whether additional channels would be enough to woo customers. League sports networks like the NFL Network, local sports networks like MSG, and Spanish-language networks are listed as options, while A&E, History Channel, Lifetime, and FYI are presented together as a single option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, ABC is also an option, but ABC, ESPN, Disney and more were added to the channel lineup shortly ahead of the nationwide launch. This is no guarantee, but it could point to Sony already being in talks to add the other programming options listed in the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "One factor that the survey doesn’t address could be one of the most important, at least according to several Reddit commenters: availability. PlayStation Vue is available on PS4 and PS3 consoles, Amazon Fire TV devices, ChromeCast, and iOS devices. This leaves out Apple TV users, but also Roku users who already have access to another similar service.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the long period when PlayStation Vue was only available in limited cities, Sling TV offered fewer channels, but at least was able to offer them everywhere, and on more devices, including the Roku. The contractual deals required to offer so many channels on PlayStation Vue may have hamstrung Sony, but if device compatibility remains limited, the service could have a hard time increasing its user base.\n",
      "Shocking Report: Chicago Police Department Is Really, Really Racist\n",
      "In November, widely maligned Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the formation of a Police Accountability Task Force, a five-member panel designed to \"review the system of accountability, oversight and training that is currently in place for Chicago's police officers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, that panel released an 18-page draft of its executive summary to the Chicago Tribune. Here's one takeaway: The Chicago Police Department is really, really racist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report states, according to the Tribune:\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism and maltreatment at the hands of the police have been consistent complaints from communities of color for decades. False arrests, coerced confessions and wrongful convictions are also a part of this history. Lives lost and countless more damaged. These events and others mark a long, sad history of death, false imprisonment, physical and verbal abuse and general discontent about police actions in neighborhoods of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's this:\n",
      "\n",
      "The community's lack of trust in CPD is justified. There is substantial evidence that people of color — particularly African-Americans — have had disproportionately negative experiences with the police over an extended period of time. There is also substantial evidence that these experiences continue today through significant disparate impacts associated with the use of force, foot and traffic stops and bias in the police oversight system itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summary goes on to make a series of recommendations, including abolishing the Independent Police Review Authority — which internally investigates misconduct allegations — and the department \"superintendent publicly acknowledging CPD's history of racial disparity and discrimination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, that the Chicago Police Department is racist amounts to maybe the worst-kept secret in America: In the past six months, the Windy City has been all but upended by the release of video footage showing police officer Jason Van Dyke killing black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, which prompted weeks of protests, the firing of former CPD superintendent Garry McCarthy and the eventual ouster at the polls of Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state's attorney who waited 400 days to charge Van Dyke with a crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the department's problems go far beyond that. For the past half century, Chicago has been reeling from the aftershock left by Jon Burge, a former CPD commander who, between 1972 and 1991, orchestrated the torture and often-false imprisonment of more than 100 people, who were \"virtually all\" black. Burge's victims were awarded portions of a $5.5 million reparations fund set up for them by the city in April 2015 — a sum that adds to the $500 million Chicago has spent on legal costs stemming from police misconduct in the last 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's just the splashy stuff. The full report is expected as early as this week, but meanwhile, the Chicago Police Department is racist, water is wet, fire is hot and ice is cold.\n",
      "\n",

      "For Trump, why Goldwater history will repeat itself in the fall\n",
      "Let's then take the argument that because Trump is winning GOP primaries in blue states by large margins that he puts those states \"in play\" in November. Trump got 60 percent of the vote in New York. That sounds great. But he received around 500,000 votes. Clinton got more than 1 million. Trump cannot win New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also can't win California even if he prevails in the state's primary by a wide margin on June 7. Currently, Clinton leads Trump by 30 points, 59 to 29, in California. There is simply no way the state becomes competitive. Clinton will easily hold onto the core elements of the Democratic Electoral College base.\n",
      "\n",
      "A better question is whether Clinton's huge advantages among women (53 percent of the 2012 vote) and minorities (28 percent) put traditional red states in play. Clinton leads Trump in Arizona and received about the same number of votes as Trump in the state's primary. Clinton also received more votes than Trump in the Georgia primary and polled very close to him in Alabama and Mississippi. She got more votes than Trump in Louisiana and Arkansas. Bernie Sanders received more votes than Trump in Oklahoma. Clinton got over 100,000 more votes than Trump in Virginia. You get the picture. Overall, Trump has received about 10 million primary votes to 12 million for Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's stipulate that anything is possible in 2016. A new, better, more presidential Trump who does not completely alienate women, African-Americans and Latinos could emerge between now and November. But we've seen how previous attempts to be \"presidential\" have gone for Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving away from his core brand of uncensored attacks could also crush Trump's turnout among white men, who he needs to win in record numbers. Clinton could somehow stumble in debates (very unlikely) or investigations into her email use could take a surprising turn (also unlikely).\n",
      "\n",
      "At bottom, there is very little reason to think the current picture — a very big Clinton win — will change very much between now and November. The GOP with Trump on the top of the ticket will probably go down to a Goldwater-type defeat and once again the Republican Party will have to try and reinvent itself at the presidential level.\n"

      "A team of Austrian, Czech, and Swedish researchers studied Mercury's singing and speaking voice, along with a professional singer to recreate his vocals. They couldn't confirm the belief that his range spanned four octaves, but they did find a number of interesting insights into his vocals. Though he was widely known as a tenor, the researchers show that he was likely a baritone. This comes from an analysis of six interviews that revealed a a median speaking fundamental frequency of 117.3 Hz.\n",
      "\n",
      "After analyzing a singer imitating Mercury's vocal performances, researchers also found that he used subharmonics, a style \"seen in a more extreme way in Tuvan throat singing where not only the vocal folds vibrate, but also a pair of tissue structures called ventricular folds, which are not normally used for speaking or classical singing,\" the study noted. Mercury also sang with an irregular vibrato. A normal vibrato lands between 5.4 Hz and 6.9 Hz, while Mercury's was at 7.04 Hz. Comparing it to legendary opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, researchers said that Mercury was vibrating something in his throat that Pavarotti wasn't even using.\n",

      "The DEA Just Approved a Way to Smoke Marijuana Legally for the First Time\n",
      "The unofficial pot-smoking holiday of April 20 may be over, but marijuana advocates got another reason to celebrate on Thursday. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for the first time approved smoking marijuana as legitimate medical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEA green-lit a clinical trial of smoked marijuana for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in American military veterans, a spokesperson for the government agency confirmed to Fortune. While other trials have studied the medical benefits of marijuana and cannabis extracts like cannabidiol, this is the first time regulators have allowed testing of the marijuana plant itself for the purpose of developing it into a legal medical drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), an organization researching legal uses for marijuana and other mind-altering drugs, is conducting the trial, which is funded by a $2.2 million grant from Colorado’s state health department. MAPS had worked for more than five years to obtain clearance from regulators to use pot in the trial; while it received the OK from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and from the U.S. Public Health Service in 2014, it still had to wait for the DEA’s approval in order to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEA’s decision marks a major shift in policy for the agency, which has long resisted the legalization of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes, and has also denied the medicinal potential of pot. Just six months ago in November, DEA head Chuck Rosenberg dismissed the concept of medical marijuana as “a joke,” according to CBS News. “What really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal—because it’s not,” he said. “If you talk about smoking the leaf of marijuana—which is what people are talking about when they talk about medicinal marijuana—it has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, however, the DEA has apparently had a change of heart, indicating earlier this month that it is considering whether to reclassify marijuana from its current category—the same one as heroin and LSD—into a lower one alongside less dangerous drugs. So far, DEA has not rejected any research studies involving marijuana products that met FDA standards, the agency’s spokesperson added. To date, 24 states have legalized the use of medical marijuana, but the DEA still considers weed illegal on a federal level.\n"

      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for tonight's episode of Arrow, titled \"Eleven Fifty-Nine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During a screening of tonight's harrowing episode of Arrow earlier this week, a number of reporters had the opportunity to see who was in the grave before it aired tonight on The CW.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Obviously Arrow is always a show that's evolving, it's always a show where you know, every character arguably except for the Arrow is fair game,\" Guggenheim said. \"And you know we started off this year with the promise of a death, and when we sort of worked our way through our various different creative choices, we realized that you know, the thing that will give us the most pop going into the end of the season and into next season unfortunately would be Laurel, and we knew by the way, we knew that it would enrage a lot of people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know, you know we're not immune to the you know, shipping, and we're not immune to the internet controversy, but...when I say immune, we're not blind to it, but you know we've never made decisions on the show creatively because of the Internet, and you know, one of the you know, one of the things we knew people were going to think is, 'Oh well, in the season were Oliver and Felicity get engaged, and Laurel dies, that's clearly making a choice about who's going to end up with who,' and truth be told, we sort of, we told the Laurel, Oliver romance story in Season One,\" Guggenheim continued. \"We told that story. We never really thought about going back to it, so the shipping the was not an element, it was not a factor for us, and we recognize that that upsets a lot of fans, particularly the comic books fans who, in the comics, Dinah Lance and Oliver Queen are in very ... depending on which version of the character you like, are in a romance together in very iterations, and that to some people is considered canonical and iconic, and we respect that, but at the same time we've always you know, made know bones about the fact that we are telling our own version of the Green Arrow mythos and you know, the Green Arrow has had so many different interpretations and blackened areas, and had so many different interpretations over the years that we never felt you know beholden to one particular interpretation, and this is our interpretation, like it or not, and I recognize that there are plenty of people up and down my Twitter feed who do not like it. Totally respect that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he said, it's a creative decision. That Arrow now exists in a world of time-travel, flashbacks, spinoffs, alternate Earths, and Lazarus Pits makes it a little easier to say good-bye to a beloved character or a fan-favorite cast member...but at the end of the day it's still mostly how a loss affects the rest of the world of the show that determines who gets the ax.\n",
      "\n",

Nearly half of female GOP primary voters said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump, according to a NBC/WSJ poll last month, while only 40 percent of male GOP primary voters said the same. And with Trump's chances of securing the nomination looking better and better, this is proving to be a trying time for Republican women.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many reasons GOP women are planning on voting for Clinton. I spoke with a few of them to better understand what exactly is motivating them to break with their party.\n",

      "\"I kind of grew up with Hillary always in the background of my adult life. She's always had an influence on me.\"\n",

      "Many women—particularly those who have watched her marriage flounder, her struggles to raise a daughter under media scrutiny, and her climb to the top of the political ladder against the odds—feel a kinship with Clinton that has less to do with politics and more do to with her biography. Asma Hasan, a Republican, considers herself part of an exclusive sisterhood that counts Clinton as its most distinguished member. She started at Wellesley College in 1993, the same year Clinton, a 1969 graduate of the college, became first lady. \"I kind of grew up with Hillary always in the background of my adult life,\" the Denver-based attorney and author tells me. \"She's always had an influence on me and how I see the world.\"\n",

And I think that one way to deal with that it is to try to support each other and mentor each other, encourage each other, give each other advice,\" she says. \"There are people out there that will not vote for her because she's female―because of sexism, that is perhaps latent and hard to identify. ...I'm a woman first before I'm a Republican,\" Hasan says. \"And I feel like having a female president is an important goal for women.

      "Some women in the GOP have found themselves drawn to Clinton not out of love for her, but fear of a Trump presidency. (Indeed, Hillary Clinton's latest ad plays like a lowlight reel of Donald Trump's foreboding overtures: \"He says we should punish women who have abortions...\" says the voiceover.) Last week, former first lady Laura Bush hinted that she'd rather see Clinton in the Oval Office than Trump. And Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey, told Bloomberg's With All Due Respect last month that she would take four more years of a Clinton administration over \"the kind of damage I think Donald Trump could do to this country, to its reputation, to the people of this country.\"\n",

      "\"He has no political experience,\" says Rumer Richardson, 26, former intern for Republican senator John Cornyn. \"I don't think bringing people to such a state of anger and unrest, like he's done at all of his rallies, is something we need in office.

Spurred by his rise and trying to keep an open mind, she went to a watch party for the second Democratic debate, in November. Compared to Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, Miller, an economics major, says it was \"striking\" how Clinton actually \"knew what the fuck was going on\" with the country's economy. While she disagreed with most of Clinton's positions, \"I can recognize when someone just knows more than I do, or when someone has seen more than I have.\"\n",

She could even imagine herself voting for Marco Rubio, even though she saw his youth and limited experience on the national stage as disadvantages. But after both men dropped out of the race, she figured it was time to broaden her horizons—especially with a Trump presidency looming. \"At this point, I'm thinking, 'Who can beat Trump?'

Richardson says she scrutinized Clinton's platform more closely so she could dismiss criticism that she was only voting for her because of her gender. Even still, there's an undercurrent of hope for Clinton rising to the most powerful office in the world.\n",

      "China Successfully Tests Hypersonic Weapon System\n",
      "China has conducted a test of its new hypersonic weapon. The test is the seventh successful test of the so-called DF-ZF, the Washington Free Beacon reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test was carried out from the Wuzhai missile test center in central China. Past DF-ZF weapons—previously called WU-14 by the Pentagon—were aimed at inner Mongolia. The test was the second major missile test in two weeks. On April 12th, a DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile was launched into the South China Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The DF-ZF is what is known as a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGF). The DF-ZF is thought to be launched by a DF-21 intermediate range ballistic missile. Unlike a typical ballistic missile warhead however, a hypersonic glide vehicle stops short of entering space and glides through the atmosphere at speeds of between 4,000 and 7,000 miles an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "A weapon traveling at such blistering speeds could hit any place on Earth in less than an hour. The unique flight profile of HGVs—not quite a ballistic missile and not quite a regular air-launched missile—combined with its extremely high speed, makes them difficult to intercept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Free Beacon emphasizes Chinese HGVs as a first strike weapon. While theoretically possible, China's strategic nuclear arsenal consists of between 200 to 300 weapons—nowhere near enough to destroy America's nuclear arsenal first even if HGVs were used to \"kick in the door\" and destroy America's ground-based missile interceptors based in Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "An operational Chinese hypersonic weapon will likely be a conventional—not nuclear—one. A HGV weapon could, for example, target Taiwanese air bases and air defenses, destroying them in minutes and helping China gain air superiority over the breakaway island. Such a weapon could even be used to target individual ships at sea, much like the DF-21D and DF-26 \"carrier killer\" ballistic missiles .\n",
      "\n",
      "China is not alone in developing hypersonic weapons. The U.S. Air Force anticipates it will have hypersonic weapons operational by the 2020s , likely based on experimental vehicles such as the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 and the X-51 WaveRider . There are reports China is particularly concerned about U.S. development of hypersonics as they could be used to target China's modest nuclear arsenal without the need for the U.S. to \"go nuclear.\"\n",

Meanwhile, the Russian Navy anticipates putting the Zircon anti-ship missile into production in 2018, which will be capable of speeds of up to 3,800 to 4,600 miles an hour.\n",

      "Why Won’t Hollywood Let Us See Our Best Black Actors?\n",
      "Idris Elba is in four major studio films this year, but you won’t see his face in any of them. Three of those high-profile jobs are voice roles: In addition to playing Chief Bogo in Zootopia and Shere Khan in The Jungle Book, Elba has a supporting part in Pixar’s upcoming Finding Dory. His only live-action role in the lot is playing the villainous Krall in Star Trek Beyond, where he’s buried under so many facial prosthetics that he’s more than unrecognizable — he’s a different color entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t fault Disney for wanting to cast Elba in all of those cartoons: The man’s got one of the best voices in cinema, rich and insinuating. And now that Elba has become something of a sci-fi staple in films like Prometheus and Pacific Rim, perhaps it was inevitable that he’d don makeup for a franchise like Star Trek. But as one of the few black leading men in Hollywood, Elba means something. So what does it say when we see so little of him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could call all these castings a fluke. I worry they’re not. Look at Lupita Nyong’o, whose most notable roles since winning the Oscar for 12 Years a Slave have been playing the orange alien Maz Kanata in Star Wars and the white wolf Raksha in The Jungle Book. In this summer’s video-game adaptation Warcraft, Paula Patton is slathered in green paint as the half-human, half-orc Garona, which makes me wonder if she consulted Zoe Saldana for advice before taking the role: After all, Saldana has already played green in Guardians of the Galaxy and blue in Avatar. (It’s become so common for Saldana to play a different color on film that they even gave her another skin tone for the controversial clusterfuck Nina and thought nothing of it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t see Leonardo DiCaprio, Sandra Bullock, and Tom Cruise painting their faces to win roles, but this color-changing gambit has practically become required of black dramatic actors who want to appear in big-budget movies. Of our A-list movie stars, the only white one regularly tinting her skin is Jennifer Lawrence, who signed a three-film contract to play Mystique in the X-Men films well before she was an Oscar-winning superstar, and whose latest go-round in the role is her least blue yet. Fox was savvy to put Lawrence’s famous white face front and center for X-Men: Apocalypse, since they now know it’s a face that sells movie tickets and magazines. So, too, could Lupita Nyong’o’s, yet since her Oscar win, no white director has cast her in a live-action role that lets her live in her own black skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it’s just another symptom of Hollywood’s current failure when it comes to actors of color: If movie studios continue to treat black faces as an onscreen rarity, it’s not much of a jump for those same stars to then be deemed exotic-looking and alien. Elba and Saldana have both played extraterrestrials several times and if Nyong’o does sign on to the sci-fi thriller Intelligent Life, as has been rumored, then only one of the four films she’s shot since 12 Years a Slave will have given her a human role to play (that would be Mira Nair’s upcoming, fact-based Queen of Katwe, which required a black woman to lead it). Patton’s casting as a half-orc in Warcraft strikes me as particularly pernicious: Only in Hollywood would someone think that the beautiful Patton’s mixed-race features could contain a dollop of monstrousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, when these are the only big roles available, who can blame these actors for taking them? When black actors want to play human beings or lead a film themselves, they’re continually forced to work outside the major studio system or in independent film. Aside from Saldana’s recurring role as Uhura in the Star Trek films — a part that has traditionally always gone to a black actress — the last time she was able to appear in her own skin in a big-budget studio film was 2011’s Colombiana. Elba’s talent has been apparent for ages, but outside of his negligible cameos in Marvel movies, he’s spent the last three years since Pacific Rim working almost exclusively in independent movies or smaller films for specialty distributors. I’m encouraged that Elba was just cast as the lead in The Dark Tower — a part not written for a black man — and I hope this can be the bulwark that lets him resemble himself onscreen from now on. Look at Will Smith, who minted his movie stardom 20 years ago after a string of lead roles that made use of his charisma, talent, and winning face. Why is Smith, whose unobscured face will be on display in this summer’s Suicide Squad, treated by Hollywood as a rare fluke, rather than as an example of what can happen for this new vanguard of dramatic black talent if we provide the right opportunities for them?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of this past year’s second straight #oscarssowhite debacle, I saw people like Spike Lee calling on Hollywood to adopt some version of the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates for the league’s top jobs. Whether or not that’s realistic, it’s not unreasonable to expect studios that use black actors’ prodigious talent in their animated films to pony up live-action roles for those thespians, too. And if they’re not going to paint Margot Robbie purple, maybe they should stop doing it to Zoe Saldana. The black actors I named in this article are some of Hollywood’s most talented and beautiful, and they deserve to be seen for countless reasons, not least because in this screwed-up world, representation must continually be fought for. Idris, Lupita, Paula, and Zoe have faces that matter. Let us see them.\n",

      "With just one week to go before some 130 countries sign a landmark agreement to tackle climate change at the United Nations, a group of roughly 150 naysayers gathered Thursday in Congress’s Rayburn Building. They were there to see and discuss “Climate Hustle,” a documentary that purports to bust the “myths and hype” and expose man-made global warming to be a hoax.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the bigger draw at the event may have been one of the panelists, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska who remains a star, albeit a controversial one, in conservative circles. The overwhelmingly sympathetic crowd—this was invitation only—murmured in agreement and chuckled at her anecdotes about liberal “fear-mongering.” Palin wasted no time, attacking “Bill Nye the Science Guy.” (Nye, a science educator, is the host of a popular children’s science show.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” Palin said. “He’s a kids’ show actor, he’s not a scientist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(She made the remark after a brief clip was shown of Nye, in which he said, good-naturedly, that he hoped climate change deniers will be rejected by the American people.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Palin bemoaned the fact that children are being taught to embrace the premise that humans are causing climate change. She added this is why “it’s so important for parents to be a greater influence than the schools.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Palin was joined in the panel discussion by David Legates, described as a “the former Delaware state climatologist,” and Marc Morano, who runs ClimateDepot.com, for the Committee For a Constructive Tomorrow (known as CFACT), co-producer and funder of the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics contend CFACT is a shill for Big Oil, though Morano claims that 85 percent of CFACTS funding comes from “individual donors.” (Mother Jones has included it among “The Dirty Dozen of Climate Change Denial.”) The screening was held in the meeting room of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, whose chairman Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tx), endorses the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moderator, conservative activist Brent Bozell, lobbed softballs at Palin. Palin’s environmental stances have included calls for more drilling in the Arctic Ocean and, she noted at the event, keeping polar bears off the threatened species list.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want life to be better for mankind,” Palin explained, “and that takes developing our natural resources.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion was being filmed to accompany Climate Hustle when it’s screened for one day at some 400 cinemas around the country on May 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie itself is a long 75 minutes, featuring various scientists who’ve either never believed in manmade global warming, or have gone rogue—disputing what is near consensus among scientists and therefore becoming virtual pariahs in their field. While the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is largely caused by the estimated 2 billion tons of CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels and other human activities, Climate Hustle, which has an oddly jaunty tone, scoffs at such alarmism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate Hustle was cowritten and narrated by Morano, a former spokesman for the most best-known climate-change denier in the senate, Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a reception after the screening, which Palin didn’t attend, Morano said he felt an urgency to produce this film, now that “President Obama has bypassed Congress” with environmental legislation, and “little rules are slipping in through the EPA.” The film is meant to be “a reality check,” he explained, adding that he’s already working on a sequel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: An earlier version incorrectly stated the number of theaters showing the film. The correct number is 400. This story also was updated to include mention of the clip of Bill Nye.\n",
      "Can You Actually Get Addicted to Sugar?\n",
      "You probably get that it's hard to have just one Starburst, M&M, spoonful of your favorite ice cream, etc. Sugary treats trigger our brain's reward system, flooding our neurons with the pleasure chemical dopamine. We feel awesome as a result but we instantly want more, as dopamine also gives rise to craving. And this is why some scientists now consider sugar to be a legitimately addictive substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "But is sugar really on par with cigarettes, alcohol, or cocaine? One study freshly published in the journal PLOS ONE offers further evidence that sugar can mess with our brains just as severely as hardcore drugs do. But the same study also suggests that interventions designed to treat substance dependence could help sugar addicts break free from being hooked on sweets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers from Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, heightened a family of lab rats' sugar cravings by granting them access to a constant supply of super-sweet water for four weeks. These rats developed a tolerance for the sweet water during this time frame, meaning they needed more and more of it to feel satisfied. (Tolerance is a hallmark of addiction, hence why the researchers wanted to build it in their subjects.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Once hooked on the sugar water, some rats were injected with a drug designed to treat nicotine addiction in humans called varenicline. Others were left to continue bingeing. Rats given varenicline were able to walk away from the sugar water feeder far more often — and easily — than their cousins who received no intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were also, not surprisingly, able to shed added pounds gained during the weeks they had access to the rodent equivalent of a dessert buffet. This led the researchers to conclude that yes, sugar addiction is legit but it might be stoppable with drugs designed to curb cravings for other addictive substances. \"Further studies are required,\" the study authors said in a press release, \"but our results do suggest that current FDA-approved nAChR drugs [i.e., varenicline] may represent a novel new treatment strategy to tackle the obesity epidemic.\"\n",

      "A little-known hacker group with ties to the Islamic State recently posted a list of over 3,000 names and addresses of New Yorkers allegedly being sought by the terrorist sect. The United Cyber Caliphate, as the group is known, published the list to the encrypted messaging app Telegram last week.\n",

      "Beginning Friday, up to a million Americans will lose access to food stamps over the course of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plunge in provision will not be due to the usual suspect — budget cuts — but rather the return of work requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 1990s, the federal government has required food stamp recipients to fulfill a work requirement in order to receive them for more than three months. But during the recession and its aftermath, those requirements were suspended out of concern that it was unfair to demand work in a period of high unemployment. Now that growth and jobs numbers are stronger, the requirements are locking back into place at a rapid pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: 7 Harmful Myths We Need to Stop Telling About Poverty\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Washington Post reports, work requirements will be reinstated in 22 states in 2016, and is estimated to cause between half a million and a million people who fit certain criteria — able-bodied, without children — to lose their benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the map made by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities below, you can see the states reinstating work requirements for the first time since the recession. Other states have already put them back in place. By the end of the year, 40 states will have strict time limits on how long people can receive food stamps without fulfilling work requirements, according to the CBPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all states reintroducing work requirements have had their economies bounce back enough that they're being forced by the federal government to return to work requirements. Instead, they're choosing to give up their exemption anyway. Why? Mainly because of local political cultures that tend to look upon the social safety net with a skeptical eye, and believe that work requirements will discourage laziness. As the Post notes, in 2016, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia's economies are weak enough to remain exempt from work requirements, but the states are reinstating them anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it fair? The labor markets in a lot of the states that have recovered more slowly are probably less healthy than they appear. There are plenty of towns in the U.S. where structural problems in the local economy have devastated people's job prospects so much that they've dropped out of the job search altogether, and don't even show up in unemployment numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even in towns and states where it's not extremely difficult to find a job, there's little evidence that making someone hungrier makes them any better at finding a job. And the option for people to use job training programs to opt out of work requirements isn't particularly effective because few states offer enough of them to their residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good news that the economy is strong enough to put most people to work again. But punishing those who haven't been able to seems like a step in the wrong direction.\n",

      "The Earth's Axis Is Tilting Thanks to Climate Change, NASA Scientists Say\n",
      "The very Earth is trembling under humanity's feet — or more accurately, smokestacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have determined climate change is actually causing the tilt of the Earth's axis to change, the Associated Press reported Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using satellite data, the scientists found as global climate change causes ice sheets across the planet to melt, releasing their water weight, the Earth's polar motion has stopped wobbling toward Canada and is now wobbling toward England.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPL scientist and study lead Surendra Adhikari told the news agency the difference was \"very dramatic,\" though functionally harmless. The data primarily serves to show the scale of human impact on the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenland has lost an average of more than 272 trillion kilograms of ice annually since 2003, along with West Antarctica losing 124 trillion kilograms and East Antarctica gaining 74 trillion kilograms of ice each year, NASA scientist and study co-author Erik Ivins told the AP.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is due to climate change without a doubt,\" Adhikari told Climate Central. \"It's related to ice sheets, in particular the Greenland ice sheet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2013 study first credited the change in the Earth's wobble, which began in 2000, to the loss of ice in the Greenland ice sheet, according to Scientific American. \"If you're losing enough mass to change the orientation of the Earth — that's a lot of mass,\" John Ries, a University of Texas at Austin senior research scientist who worked on that research, told the magazine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming scholarly consensus is that rising average global temperatures are the result of mass human industrial activity, with emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to blame. 2015 was the hottest year ever recorded by scientists, according to NASA, beating the record set in just 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I've noted elsewhere, the likelihood that two consecutive record-breakers would have happened by chance — in the absence of global warming — is less than 1 in 1,000,\" Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael E. Mann told Mic in January. \"Despite the continued false claims by climate change contrarians to the contrary, the globe continues to warm at the rate that the models predict it should be warming given our ongoing burning of fossil fuels.\"\n",
      "First Class Cabins Are Setting Off Air Rage, Study Finds\n",
      "If you’ve found yourself bristling when settling into your seat on an airplane, particularly if you’re back in coach, there’s a reason. A new study by researchers at the University of Toronto and Harvard Business School suggest that the cabin becomes a microcosm of a class-based society and that physical and situational inequality sets off antisocial behavior, more common known as air rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katherine DeCelles from the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management and Michael Norton from Harvard analyzed an international airline’s database of thousands of incident reports, involving millions of flights. It found that cases of “air rage” are more frequent on flights when there’s a first class cabin. And the unruly and abusive behavior is more likely to occur in both first class and economy class when economy passengers have to walk through the first class section while boarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking that humbling walk past those already seated in first class becomes a clear reinforcement of their “relatively disadvantaged status,” the authors wrote, which can “prompt negative emotions and aggressive [behavior].” And the antisocial behavior can come from the haves as well as the have-nots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost 84% of the incidents occurred in economy class, while 15% happened in first class. Men were involved in more than three times the number of incidents than women, and usually the target was a flight attendant, not other passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately the shrinking room in passenger seats, especially in economy, has been a source of complaints, and flight attendants have suggested it is leading to more air rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this new study identifies the physical layout and boarding procedures that trigger air rage. The study also found that air rage among first class passengers increased when there were more first class seats, larger cabins, and delayed flights. The incidents in first class were more likely to involve a passenger being belligerent or angry. DeCelles calls this “entitled reactions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In economy class, the incidents tended to emotional outbursts, the result of stress, fear or frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data available to the researchers did not include how many people were in each section of the plane, so it is impossible to know for certain whether people in economy are actually more likely to undergo air rage than those in first class or if the greater number of cases was due to there being more people in economy than first class. In addition, it may be that more planes have forward entry than middle, so comparing air rage rates by absolute numbers based on how people board could also be misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "With first class cabins getting more lush and larger, the risk of air rage could grow. “As both inequality and class-based airplane seating continue to rise, incidents of air rage may similarly climb in frequency,” the authors note.\n",
      "The Apocalypse: Here's When Science Says the World Will End\n",
      "The world didn't end when the Mayans said it would: Dec. 21, 2012 came and went without the long-predicted apocalypse. Which means that we still have that to look forward to. Inquiring minds want to know when; enterprising individuals want to prepare. So when will the world meet its end? When is the apocalypse, not according to some random internet pastor but according to science?\n",
      "\n",
      "There's this thing called the Doomsday Clock. Every year, a board of geniuses convenes to determine how it should be reset — sort of like daylight savings, but less predictable and miles more disconcerting. As the Telegraph reported, these knowledgable few declared in January that 2016 puts us as close as we have ever been to midnight on the clock, which is to say, the apocalypse.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, we are currently three minutes to midnight, when we will have \"destroy[ed] our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making.\" This reckoning takes into account nuclear weapons, climate change, biotechnology and emerging technologies (cyber tech, for example). Since 1945, scientists have been charting our demise with the clock — we haven't been this close to the apocalypse since \"the early days of hydrogen bomb testing,\" the Telegraph reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists isn't the only group speculating on when, precisely, the world will end. Researchers at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute teamed up with the Global Challenges Foundation and released a report in 2015 that listed 12 potential death blows that civilization could be dealt. There's not a time stamp on any of them, but one can weigh the purported risks against our current global situations to get an idea of appropriate apocalypse stress level.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the report, the clear and present dangers break down into four categories. When it comes to \"current risks,\" there's \"extreme climate change,\" \"nuclear war,\" \"ecological catastrophe,\" \"global pandemic\" and \"global system collapse\" to dread. \"Exogenic risks\" include \"major asteroid impact\" and \"supervolcano.\" Emerging risks are \"synthetic biology,\" \"nanotechnology,\" \"artificial intelligence\" and the ambiguous \"uncertain risks.\" There's just one \"global policy risk,\" and it is \"future bad global governance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "genuinely pretty sure merging of the Donald Trump subreddit and the Milo Yianoppoulus drama-troll hivemind is sign of imminent apocalypse\n",
      "\n",
      "One might think about ebola, or our rising global temperatures, or all the nukes in the hands of all the countries, or the smorgasbord of A.I. technologies or the incredibly realistic synthetic skin we're now growing in labs and start to feel a little queasy. One might ruminate on the improbable rise of a reality television star/billionaire to the position of Republican frontrunner for U.S. presidency and feel compelled to start building the bunker now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But science can't really say how or when the world will end, at least, not at present. Who knows? Maybe it'll be death by zombie for all of us. Or, the earth will hang in there for another 6 billion years before it's cannibalized by our dying sun. Outlook: hazy.\n",

      "Jessa Duggar posted a seemingly innocent photo of her 5-month-old son Sturgeon on Instagram, and the mom-shaming trolls lost it on her yet again. Worried parents took issue with the fact that her little boy was hanging out in his car seat, prompting speculation about the child's safety.\n",

      "Under the \"more\" category are things like vegetables, fruits and nuts — staples of a balanced, healthful diet. The \"less\" section includes red meat (which has been linked to heart disease), sugar and salt.

      "For many people, navigating the internet's labyrinth of health blogs and food websites for the secret to healthy eating can feel overwhelming. Sometimes, simple is better.

      "When you’re a seven-year-old boy being transported in a container by human traffickers, it helps to have a cell phone. According to 50-year-old Liz Clegg, the story of the child’s life-saving text message arose from volunteer work Clegg did at the Calais Jungle camp, a camp in Calais, France that houses hundreds of migrants, reports the NY Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in that camp that Clegg distributed dozens of phones to children as a way for them to communicate with someone in the event they found themselves in a rough spot. And unfortunately, that’s what happened to Ahmed, a seven-year-old Afghan boy who, along with 14 other migrants, were being illegally transported to an unknown location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the phone he had been given, Ahmed frantically texted Clegg, broken English and all. “I ned halp darivar no stap car no oksijan in the car no signal iam in the cantenar. Iam no jokan valla,” read the text. Clegg figured out that the text stated, “I need help. The driver won’t stop the car. No oxygen in the car. No signal. I’m in a container. I am not joking, I swear to God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clegg then called Tanya Freedman, a member of the London-based charity Help Refugees, and Freedman alerted the authorities. By tracing the phone’s location to a highway service station in Leicestershire, England, police intercepted the truck and found the 15 oxygen-starved migrants, including Ahmed.\n",

      "“It was absolutely nerve-wracking, waiting to see if the police could find this boy in time to save his life,” said Freedman.\n",

      "One man was arrested on suspicion of illegal trafficking, while several others were held on suspicion of entering England illegally. Ahmed, meanwhile, was placed under protective custody due to his age. Understandably, Freedman is still beside herself as to how all of this unfolded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s extraordinary that a seven-year-old boy knew his life was in danger and had the presence of mind to know what to do and give the right information and save himself and the others in the truck. We hope he’s getting the right kind of care.”\n"

      "Last Thursday, the body of missing firefighter Nicole Mittendorff was found in Shenandoah National Park. According to local news station WHSV, police found a note near the deceased and determined that Mittendorff had committed suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the discovery of Mittendorff's body, investigators found that she had been the victim of vicious, sexist cyberbullying by her coworkers on a local forum called the Fairfaxunderground. \"A new tramp emerges for us to watch destroy herself. Nicole Mittendorff at 32 is already slutting her way around the county, \" one user wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, fire Chief Richard Bowers released a statement saying that the authorities are aware of the posts, and the department \"will thoroughly investigate this matter and take any appropriate actions needed.\" Mic reached out on Monday to see if there are any specific plans to address sexism in the firehouse, and was told the administration has \"no further comment\" beyond Bowers published statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Virginia fire department has a history of slut shaming female coworkers, often naming and discussing specific coworkers on this forum. Back in 2014, a female forum user who went by the username funtimegal shared her experience of being sexually harassed in the predominantly male culture of the local fire department.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a firefighter for 15 years,\" funtimegal wrote. \"I know guys talk behind my back and have seen pictures of me in their lockers. I have been passed up for promotions because of what the board 'have heard'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind of bullying Mittendorff faced isn't unique to the Fairfax County Fire Department. Former California firefighter Alicia Dabney told the New York Times that her workplace had a \"frat boy atmosphere\" and described finding fliers with the words \"Alicia Dabney is a whore\" on the floor of the fire station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retired deputy fire chief John Murphy in Washington has been outspoken about the need to address misogynistic firehouse culture across the country. \"There's a feeling that women don't belong in the fire service,\" Murphy said in a phone interview. \"There are a lot of women who are sexually harassed, bullied and raped on duty who don't report it because they want to continue their jobs... there needs to be an anonymous reporting mechanism, for people who are harassed, that will actually lead to action to stop that behavior.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From assault to bullying, Murphy believes many firefighters are afraid to report workplace sexism because they don't think they'll get help. \"Often when it is reported, the administration doesn't do anything about it,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy believes the firehouse culture is still a \"good old white boys club,\" where women, people of color and LGBTQ firefighters often face hostile work environments. \"I'm familiar with two or three gay firefighters and it took them a while to find a place where they weren't harassed,\" Murphy said. \"There's an attitude of 'you need to find somewhere else to work.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unclear whether harassment was a contributing factor in Mittendorff's decision to take her own life. Either way, however, Bowers denied to WHSV that the fire department offered a hostile, potentially sexually abusive environment for female coworkers.\n",

      "Here's the Truth About Gigi Hadid's New Bangs\n",
      "Gigi Hadid's chunky new bangs were arguably the *star* of the MTV Video Awards last night – closely followed by Zac Efron's biceps. We were totally obsessing over the bold look, but at the same time, we wondered whether Gigi really chopped her hair or if she was hair-pranking us, like she did with her faux bob at the 2015 American Music Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out, Gigi was rocking faux fringe after all. Her hairstylist Bryce Scarlett confirmed that Gigi's beauteous new bangs are all thanks to a sneaky clip-in wig. Scarlett told Seventeen.com, \"It is a very like small partial wig – it's a clip-on piece. The whole little front piece is faux. None of her hair was cut.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Even though Gigi looked totally killer with the edgy fringe, Scarlett says we probably won't be seeing this look on Gigi long-term. \"I mean never say never, but I think that the fun in all this – the fun of it being just for a night – is that for someone like Gigi who is a model and changes her look every day for work she... needs to be able to do something fun like this for a night and then take it away so she has enough hair to work with for the next [photo shoot].\"\n",

      "When it comes to North Carolina's House Bill 2, the state's NAACP branch wants the legislature to know: We're not going to stand for it. Literally.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 23, North Carolina passed HB 2, a law requiring citizens to use the bathroom that matches the gender they were assigned at birth rather than the gender they identity as — and it hasn't taken long for critics of the bill to speak out. There has already been a statewide PayPal pullout and a canceled Bruce Springsteen concert among other protests against the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the North Carolina NAACP is threatening to stage a series of sit-ins if the legislature does not repeal HB 2 by April 21. At a press conference on Saturday, Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said that he would call the bill, \"Hate Bill 2.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are organizing and planning now a campaign of mass sit-ins at the general assembly, calling on people of faith, people of conscience to join as a moral witness against this unconstitutional and immoral legislation,\" Barber said. \"We cannot allow this kind of codifying hate in our constitution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber explained what he believed to be the true motivations behind the bill. \"Hate Bill 2 ... is a race-based, class-based, homophobic discriminatory bill ... that is nothing more than the politics of Jesse Helms revisited,\" Barber said. Helms was a famous 1960s-era conservative from North Carolina who stridently opposed civil rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Barber, HB 2 was never about bathrooms. \"It's not about bathrooms, just like segregated bathrooms was never about bathrooms,\" he said. \"It was about a political statement; it was about oppression; it was about having public signs of domination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber was adamant that the religious reasons for the bill were misguided and hypocritical, stating that true religion would be on the side of the marginalized and oppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True religion starts with how you care for the poor, the least of these, the broken and the marginalized and the pushed out and the stranger,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Carolina legislature is not due to return until April 25, which means that they would have to convene a special session in order to repeal the law before then. Thus far, lawmakers have claimed they are unwilling to do so. While convening an \"emergency session\" sounds like a Herculean task, there is precedent: HB 2 itself was actually passed by North Carolina lawmakers during an \"emergency session,\" and Gov. Pat McCrory signed the bill later that same night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite zero recorded instances of a trans person ever assaulting someone in a bathroom, HB 2 is currently law in North Carolina. Thankfully, the NAACP will stand up and sit down for the rights of North Carolina's transgender citizens.\n",
      "The Fed 'is a god that has failed'—George Gilder—commentary\n",
      "The reason, as I document in my book, \"The Scandal of Money: Why Wall Street Recovers but the Economy Never Does\" is that Washington and the Federal Reserve together have created a closed loop economy where the Fed creates money for the government and the S&P 500 and Main Street is left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed decides what money is worth and who receives it and how much. The Fed prices it at zero interest rates, allegedly to stimulate economic growth. But whenever something is free, it's distributed by queue, and only the privileged, connected people in the front of the line get any, not the innovators who create growth and opportunity for Main Street. Trump voters are wrong if they blame Mexico and China, but they are right about one big thing: The economy is rigged against them.\n",
      "Michael Jordan, King of North Carolina, Has Come Out Against Gov. Pat McCrory's HB2 Bill\n",
      "Michael Jordan, king of the court and keeper of the keys to North Carolina's heart, is speaking out against the state's anti-trans legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signed into law on March 23 by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, House Bill 2 bans transgender individuals from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity and forbids local municipalities from prohibiting sexual orientation- and gender based-discrimination in their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being challenged repeatedly on the legislation, McCrory has stayed the course, maintaining that the law is a \"common sense\" proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement to the Charlotte Observer, the famously apolitical basketball legend shared that he and his franchises do not support the new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment,\" Jordan said in a statement to the Observer in response to an interview request regarding HB2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raw Story reported that although some have dismissed his statement as \"weak,\" Jordan is known for steering clear of political controversy. He stayed silently when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar publicly accused him of ignoring human rights violations by Nike in favor of making profits, and refused to endorse Harvey Gantt, an African American Democrat, who ran for North Carolina Senate against noted segregationist Jesse Helms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events at Time Warner Cable Arena,\" Jordan's statement said.\n",

Calls to the Trans Crisis Hotline have nearly doubled since the legislation was passed, and a host of musicians, corporations and circuses have pulled the plug on their tours and business ventures in the state.\n",

      "Erin Schrode talked to a lot of people before she decided to run for Congress, but one conversation really stuck in her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had sought out the advice of an older male friend about waging a campaign to unseat an incumbent in her California district. \"He put his hand on my knee and said, 'Sweetie, just wait 20 years [and] maybe you can run,'\" she recalled in an interview Monday.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Why she's running: Schrode summed up her rationale for running in a March 29 Medium post:\n",
      "\n",
      "Broken policy is failing us all, as fear and vitriol permeate politics. I can no longer watch as partisan gridlock threatens our future and that of communities around the country. We need common sense reform? —? and we need it en masse, yesterday. Clean water is a human right. Women add value to society. Mental health is a veritable illness. Black lives matter. Affordable healthcare helps families. Education can be an economic engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's time to deliver on the promise of my generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schrode's website described her as a \"citizen activist, community organizer and vocal advocate for environmental action, social justice, public health and responsible consumption.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her activist roots go back to 2005, when reports of high cancer rates in her home county spurred her to co-found Turning Green, \"a national nonprofit organization devoted to education and advocacy around environmentally sustainable and socially responsible choices for individuals, schools and communities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York University graduate knows she doesn't fit the mold of the stereotypical American politician (\"I think man, I think middle-aged, I think law degree,\" she said) and that's part of what she said is right about her campaign to unseat Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You should have a breadth of backgrounds in Congress — and right now we just don't,\" she said in a phone conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Schrode insisted that she doesn't want to be judged on her age or gender, but by her ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty-something: At the moment, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress is New York Republican Elise Stefanik. The Harvard graduate was 30 when she won her upstate 21st District seat, and now chairs the Millennial Task Force of the House Policy Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schrode sees Stefanik not merely as the nation's youngest congresswoman (to date), but \"an intelligent, capable elected official who is young and who is a woman,\" although they have divergent political views.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stefanik's sex and her age alone, Schrode said, \"should not define her. That should not define me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Erin Schrode\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital footprint: Another thing Schrode said sets her apart from older officials and candidates: Like her millennial peers, she grew up a digital native. \"I had Facebook throughout high school,\" she said. \"I Instagram the food that I eat. I am vocal about my points of view on Twitter. There's a 10-year digital footprint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She's proud of the life she's lived (and documented), she said, \"It's been a journey of someone who was never preparing to be a politician.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Change from within: After a life of world travels, speeches and advocacy, Schrode said she ultimately realized that although she hadn't planned on politics, it would be the best way for her to bring the changes she wants to see in environmental protection, public health, women's rights and social justice — in Northern California and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The people I want to vote for won't run for office. The most talented, capable individuals of integrity that I know don't want to be associated with politics. That's a problem,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",

That has its advantages considering how large 4K titles are (around 40GBs or more). However, to use Ultra, you need to utilize a newer Sony TV.

Many titles support HDR, but selections are effectively limited to Sony Pictures movies and TV shows. Sony films on your UltraViolet catalog can also be streamed on Ultra, and Sony will even let users upgrade Sony UltraViolet titles to 4K “for a special discounted price.” But frankly, you will be hard-pressed to find virtually anyone using Ultra, as its many restrictions make it one of the least enticing services on the list, and one of the least battle-tested.\n",

At first the only games to take advantage of this increased visual fidelity were 2018 World Cup matches, but now the service is streaming some NCAA football games in 4K as well. While 4K content is still fairly limited, this means that the service is equipped to show both Fox and FS1 in 4K with HDR10, so if nothing else, expect to see more live sports making use of these technologies moving forward.

      "Donald Trump is already in hot water with women, 73% of whom disapprove of the GOP frontrunner according to recent polls. Now, he’s poised to infuriate another massive voting block: parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Republican candidate has increasingly been portraying himself as a family man, often joined on the stump by his three eldest children—Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric—his comments in series of past interviews reveal retrograde ideas about fatherhood that are out of step with today’s America, where both parents work in nearly half of all two-parent households.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buzzfeed took a look back at a series of interviews from 2003 to 2007, in which Trump held forth on fatherhood, taking care of the kids, and parental gender roles. The real estate mogul, who is not exactly known for being consistent, stayed on message about parenthood throughout: Dads supply the money, moms do everything else.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Trump doesn’t change diapers…\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t do that,” Trump said on the Opie and Anthony show in 2005. “There’s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there’s a lot of husbands that listen to that… I’m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don’t. It’s just not for me.”\n",

      "“I mean, I won’t do anything to take care of them. I’ll supply funds and she’ll take care of the kids. It’s not like I’m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park,” Trump said in a 2005 interview with Howard Stern. “Marla used to say, ‘I can’t believe you’re not walking Tiffany down the street,’ you know in a carriage. Right, I’m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn’t work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just babies that Trump avoids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 2007 interview, Trump told Stern about his relationship with Tiffany, his daughter with Marla Marples. Trump said that Tiffany visits him, “You know for about an hour, ‘Hi dad,’ Hi Tiff, I love you Tiff.’ She’s a great kid,” says Trump, who tells Stern that Tiffany’s a smart girl—something he knows because he “glances” at her report cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps he’s trying to patch things up with Tiffany after his comments on a previous Howard Stern Show?\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to Stern in 2003, Trump said he married Maples because she got pregnant with Tiffany. “At the time it was like, ‘Excuse me, what happened?” Trump said. “And then I said, ‘Well, what are we going to do about this?'”\n",

      "Bill O'Reilly sat down with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show last night, and, as usual in these encounters, he stayed cool, calm, and collected. OK, obviously not. To be fair, the discussion was mostly relaxed as it wound through the primaries (they're over) and O'Reilly's cozy relationship with Donald Trump (something about milkshakes). But then it was time to discuss why, exactly, the Orange One is increasingly close to becoming the most powerful person in the world. That's when O'Reilly looked like he might go all Inside Edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservatives, O'Reilly told Colbert, feel they're losing The Culture War—the battle for America's soul that began in the '90s—to Colbertian progressives. Conservatives feel the Republican establishment has deserted them in that fight, so they've turned to the guy whose opposition to gay marriage is largely inconsistent and who doesn't care if Caitlyn Jenner uses the women's bathrooms at his tower. I guess Bill O meant the immigration stuff?\n",
      "\n",
      "The real consequences of political correctness, O'Reilly explained, are far more grave. When Colbert asked for an example, the Fox host cited Kate Steinle's death at the hands of an illegal immigrant in San Francisco last year, and Congress' subsequent refusal to pass \"Kate's Law,\" which would impose stiff penalties on people who are deported and re-enter the country. This was just as much Republicans' fault, apparently, which is why people like Trump now. (Trump almost exclusively refers to the victim in this case as \"the lovely Kate.\") O'Reilly demonstrated this by gesticulating wildly:\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",

      "\"They expect Harry Reid [not to do the right thing],\" O'Reilly said, \"He's corrupt. But they don't expect their leadership to not do anything!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It only took a few vigorous hand motions to demonstrate that political correctness is at the root of all the country's problems, and that spineless Republicans have allowed it to fester. This was not the best moment of the interview (that was O'Reilly's \"I'm not arrogant enough to say this person or that person isn't qualified\") but it was almost as entertaining as the first meeting between these two.

      "\"I think it's fair to say that whatever mistakes I made, I was hung out to dry by a lot of people—by a lot of the feminists who had loud voices. I wish it had been handled differently.

      "Lewinsky states that she came \"very close\" to attempting suicide, even going so far as to figure out how she'd do it. \"I think some young people don't see suicide as an ending, but as a reset.\"\n",

It’s nearly impossible to say which phone is better, since they boast nearly identical spec sheets.\n",

      "Both phones have comparable batteries, but the S7 Edge has 3,600mAh battery compared to the HTC 10’s 3,000mAh battery. The HTC 10 also offers Quick Charge 3.0, which is faster than Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge with Quick Charge 2.0. The difference in charging speed is pretty minimal, and you’d really need to sit down with a stopwatch to tell the difference. Even so, it seems like a strange choice on Samsung’s part to go with the older standard.\n",

      "However, the S7 Edge supports wireless charging, and the HTC 10 doesn’t, so it’s a toss up as to what’s more important to you. Wireless charging is mighty convenient, assuming you have a wireless charging dock, and it’s a forward thinking addition. If you’ve always dreamed about leaving wires behind, you’ll love the S7 Edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make up for its lack of wireless charging, the HTC 10 uses a USC Type-C port, which is easier to plug in and more modern than the Micro USB port on the S7 Edge. You can plug your cable in either direction — it doesn’t matter, because there’s no wrong way to do it. Anyone who’s fumbled around with a Micro USB at night knows the struggle and will appreciate the reversible USB C. however, you will have to change your cords and replace any accessories that depend on Micro USB ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung opted out of the growing trend toward USB Type-C, because its Gear VR headset uses the Micro USB port to connect. As fans of the Gear VR, that’s a sufficiently satisfying explanation for us!\n",

      "Both phones run Android 6.0, although the HTC 10 incorporates the Sense user interface and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge has TouchWiz on top. Overall, HTC has decided to move closer to standard Android, dropping many of its own apps in favor of Google’s. HTC scaled Sense UI back dramatically, so you can barely tell it’s there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Galaxy S7 Edge comes encumbered with plenty of carrier bloatware, Samsung apps, and a noticeable UI. Verizon, for example, installs a number of unremovable games and apps on the S7 Edge, which can be an annoyance. Those looking for a “pure” Android experience may find neither phone to their liking, but the HTC 10 is undoubtedly closer to Google’s designed look and feel for Android.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, you’re stuck with TouchWiz unless you want to download a launcher. HTC offers much more customization options, including an entire theme store where you can choose from a variety of different icon packs, wallpapers, and color schemes. HTC also introduced fun stickers for those who want to try their hand at designing fun interfaces for the 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Edge does offer some fun, helpful functionality like app shortcuts, quick actions, news, and more. It’s a versatile feature that’s sure to grow as more developers make edge panels, which is truly exciting. Right now, it’s still not quite as useful as we’d like, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to Android phones, the other big factor you need to consider is security. The security of a device is directly related to how frequently and quickly software is updated. In recent years, Android has been hit by several huge hacks, including Heartbleed and Stagefright, both of which made millions of devices vulnerable to hackers. If your phone doesn’t get the necessary security patches in the form of software updates, your device remains vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Android manufacturers and carriers are notoriously bad at delivering timely updates to software. However, HTC claims that it ranks second, only behind Google, for releasing timely updates to its devices. In other words, the 10 should get the latest version of Android long before the Galaxy S7 Edge does. Samsung’s commitment to quick updates is less solid, so in that regard, the HTC 10 is the safer bet.\n",

It’s arguably the most beautiful Android phone in existence — unless you hate fingerprints and glass backs. Its sleek, curvy glass front and back is encased in sturdy aluminum, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is truly a sight to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, HTC is not content to lose any beauty contests, and really emphasizes the aesthetics of the HTC 10, comparing it to the “poetry of light.” It’s a romantic view to take of a smartphone, but the HTC 10 certainly lives up to it, with a seamless aluminum body and glass screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HTC 10 has a gentle curve to its back, and the edges are chamfered to make the phone easier to grip. The 10 recalls the glory days of HTC design, when the company was the only Android phone maker that cared about how its phones looked. The edges catch the light in a beautiful way, and the sleek, all glass front looks gorgeous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both devices have fingerprint sensors on the front, which is unusual for Android smartphones these days. However, the HTC 10’s sensor is faster, because it’s not a button. With the Galaxy S7 Edge, you have to press the button to unlock your phone, which seems like an unnecessary step.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HTC 10 is slightly larger than the S7 Edge, though most users probably will not notice the difference. Like a gem, the HTC 10 is not only pretty but sturdy, designed to survive even the worst falls without shattering. The metal 10 is tougher than the fragile glass Galaxy S7 Edge, but both the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 Edge are slender, shimmering beauties. The main downside to the Galaxy S7 Edge’s design is that glass is not only fragile, but also picks up fingerprints like crazy. However, if you lead a more aquatic life, the S7 may be the more reliable phone given it’s waterproof, whereas the HTC 10 is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, it comes down to style preference, because both are beautiful phones. The HTC 10 is more subtle, but the Galaxy S7 Edge is sexier and flashier. For our tastes, the Galaxy S7 Edge is nicer, though you need a case with either phone.\n",

This time, the Hi-fi speakers are on the bottom edge and top of the device. Even so, the HTC 10 promises 24-bit audio and stellar sound from its speakers. In our experience, the 10’s sound isn’t as good as it was on the One M8, but it’s still much better than most, including the Galaxy S7 Edge. Although the Galaxy S7 Edge doesn’t sound too shabby, it’s not as strong a performer in the audio space.\n",

      "HTC also takes its obsession with sound further on the 10. You can set up your own sound profile for when you listen to all your high-res tracks. To really sell audiophiles on the phone, HTC even partnered up with JBL to make the Reflect Aware C earbuds, which you can buy separately. For those who like to listen to music or watch movies on their phone, the HTC 10’s sound quality move the needle.\n",

This means that both phones can take pictures of excellent quality, even in low-light environments.\n",

Meanwhile, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge uses dual pixel technology to focus quickly, sports an f/1.7 aperture, and boasts a 1.4 µm pixel size.\n",

      "Camera review site DxOMark praised the HTC 10 for its good exposure and balance of white and colors, although the review notes that low-light conditions resulted in luminance noise.\n",

The HTC 10 occasionally has trouble focusing, though, and the S7 Edge proved more reliable and easy to use. Both phones offer a simple camera app and a very high-end photography experience. The two phones arguably offer the best camera performance of any smartphone, though the S7 Edge has the edge here.\n",

Currently, the HTC 10 can only be purchased unlocked, though the model is compatible with both AT&T and T-Mobile networks. HTC also says that Verizon and Sprint will soon be carrying it. The S7 Edge, meanwhile, is available through AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular. It’s impossible to buy the S7 Edge unlocked, which is really its only disadvantage. No unlocked phones means lots of carrier bloatware and a lot of difficulty if you decide to switch.\n",

The HTC 10’s hi-res audio offers an intriguing advantage, but how much that matters depends on a user’s preferences. Those who like pure Android and some choice in how their phone’s interface looks will prefer the 10. The other main appeal of the 10 is its all metal design. It looks sleek, but not too flashy, and it’s more durable that the Galaxy S7 Edge’s curved glass body.\n",

      "Caitlyn Jenner's impromptu bathroom break at Trump Tower last week has seemingly failed to warm the heart of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper last week, the notoriously anti-LGBT senator said that he is standing firm in his belief that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity \"opens the door for predators.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jenner made her political pit stop in protest of recent legislation, like North Carolina's HB2 law, which are aimed at preventing transgender individuals from using the bathroom that they feel most comfortable with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her homemade footage of the excursion, Jenner addresses Cruz directly after using the ladies' room in a building owned by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Donald, I really appreciate it,\" Jenner says in the footage, \"And by the way, Ted [Cruz], nobody got molested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz, who is currently vying to become the Republican presidential nominee, said that the bathroom legislation is a safeguard against threats to women's safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not a matter of right or left, or Democrat or Republican. This is common sense. It doesn't make sense for grown adult men, strangers, to be alone in a restroom with a little girl,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz cited his \"years in law enforcement\" as the basis for his beliefs, although it remains unclear which experience the senator was referring to specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've spent a lot of years in law enforcement dealing with child predators that are sick individuals,\" Cruz said. \"That doesn't mean that that is the people who are transgendered. But there are predators in the world, and just saying that you're a man, you can go in the girls' restroom if you feel like it, opens the door for criminals.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, there have been no reported cases of a transgender person attacking someone in a bathroom.\n",
      "Trump loves Melania, but he really likes Sue: Huh?\n",
      "\"Most successful candidates usually keep their lawyers out of sight,\" said Randy Evans, an Atlanta attorney who chairs the Republican National Lawyers Association. \"Trump is the first to move them front and center.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Evans and others note the conspicuous cable news presence of Trump's longtime corporate counsel, Michael Cohen, who has moonlighted as a regular surrogate since his boss announced his presidential bid. In an email to CNBC.com, Cohen dismissed the idea that his role was noteworthy or unusual. \"To be noted, I am not part of the campaign and make that clear in every appearance,\" he told CNBC.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But political law veterans on both sides of the aisle insist Trump's bear hug of the legal profession flies in the face of the most elementary campaign wisdom. Moreover, his litigious rhetoric has confounded the traditional left-right paradigm over the issue of tort reform. After all, aren't trial lawyers supposed to be the tools?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trump looks more like poster child for tort reform than anything I have ever done,\" said Steve Mostyn, a Houston attorney and prominent Democratic mega-donor. \"Anytime you have the leading candidate for a presidential nomination talking about expansion of litigation, you lose some of the demonizing [Republicans] have done. … He certainly is espousing a line that's contradictory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This line — which includes a declaration of intent to open up the country's libel laws, if elected president — has horrified the right-leaning tort reform community. The American Tort Reform Association has called out Trump for being a \"sore loser\" who undermines the effort to \"contain the plaintiff's bar.\" And legal scholars on the right insist that this, as much as anything, belies Trump's conservative identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This places him in many respects with people on the left,\" said Roger Pilon, vice president of legal affairs at the Libertarian CATO Institute.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, Trump is not the only Republican who is flummoxing anti-litigation activists. Cruz has his own contradictory history: He has staunchly advocated for tort reform as a U.S. senator and Texas solicitor general but has also helped protect multimillion dollar plaintiff judgments while working as an appellate lawyer for a large firm in Houston. (Cruz's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n",

Melissa was one of us. If she has a spare moment to run over [to the set] — even if for just a cameo — we would be totally game. And if it’s a last-minute thing, I would write her in and we would figure it out. That’s the way we left it.”\n",

I’ll pre-light it for her. She can drive up, run in, shoot it, and run out. I can get her in and out in two hours.”\n",

      "Let’s get to the point: the first trailer for Toho’s reboot of the Godzilla franchise, Godzilla Resurgence, dropped earlier today and in a word, it’s breathtaking. Showcasing a back to basics approach to Kaiju films, it draws heavily from the 1954 original, released when Japan was still recovering from World War II and inspired by the devastation of the war’s final days. Here, we see that earlier film’s depiction of remote, godlike terror with modern effects and techniques. Sure, the monster still looks like a man in a suit and yet, it’s genuinely terrifying. It helps, of course, that the the scale of the attack is both distant and personal, as shown by Godzilla towering over the city he’s plodding through, and the focus on on-the-ground devastation. Watch the clip above now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Announced back in 2014 in the wake of Legendary’s successful American take on the classic Kaiju, Godzilla Resurgence is a full reboot of the 30-odd film series, and the first to come out of Japan since 2004’s Godzilla: Final Wars. Co-directed by Neon Genesis Evangelion co-creator Hideaki Anno and Gamera storyboard artist Shinji Higuchi from a script by Hideaki, it hits Japanese theaters July 29.\n",

      "The Bigfoot Mystery May Actually Be Explained by This Extinct Creature\n",
      "Think Bigfoot is just a legend? Think again... maybe. Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, is a mythical human-like, hairy creature whose unproven existence has inspired reports of sightings for years. But there's actually a long-extinct giant ape called Gigantopithecus that roamed the Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago — and its existence has lead some to wonder, is this the \"real\" Bigfoot?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), which calls itself \"the only scientific research organization exploring the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery,\" Bigfoot is \"a large, hairy, bipedal non-human primate.\" Hmm, that sounds a lot like the Gigantopithecus, which was an enormous ape that stood more than 10 feet tall and weighed 1,200 pounds, according to Smithsonian.\n",
      "\n",
      "While today's Bigfoot sightings are probably just wishful thinking, Gigantopithecus was very, very real. First discovered in 1935, the ape genus appears to have lived in South Asia and ate a diet of fruits, seeds and grasses like bamboo, Smithsonian reported. Like its modern cousin, the orangutan, Gigantopithecus probably walked on all fours using its feet and fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not clear exactly why Gigantopithecus went extinct: It may have been hunted to death by other primates or had lethally low reproductive rates, according to Smithsonian. But some believers claim that Gigantopithecus and Bigfoot are one and the same, and that the giant ape never went extinct after all, theorizing that it's just hiding in forests and popping out periodically to surprise hikers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But scientists seem certain that Gigantopithecus is long-gone, so its huge fossilized teeth may be the closest we'll ever get to the \"real Bigfoot.\"\n",

      "On the heels of a seriously heartbreaking story about a 3-month-old who died on her first day of daycare, a woman named Deborah Stokes is making headlines for operating a string of \"disastrous\" Christian daycares all over southern Alabama for a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stokes began opening daycares 14 years ago in Saraland, Alabama, according to Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. Just weeks into her new career, authorities discovered she was keeping kids in a building that didn't meet basic health and safety standards. Stokes was arrested for child endangerment, criminally charged, and later convicted. She also was banned from operating a daycare for two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon enough, she was back at it. She opened a daycare in a decrepit warehouse that one worker described as a \"house out of a horror movie.\" Another was next to a porn store. Parents and workers have reported Stokes for abuse and neglect — hitting kids with flyswatters, locking them in closets, rapping them with rulers, and failing to pay employees, according to police reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course police, county health officials, city council members, building inspectors, and tons of former employees and upset parents have tried to take action, but they can't seem to stop Stokes. When she's forced to close one of her daycares, she just opens another in a neighboring town. This is all possible, because daycares that identify as religious, like Stokes's, are exempt from certain licensing rules and don't require any real government oversight in 16 states, including Alabama.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2006, the Alabama Department of Human Resources didn't verify the safety requirements of one of her daycares in Mobile, because they trusted that churches would tell the truth about complying with the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within months, a county health inspector named Alice Rollins was responding to parents' complaints and found babies lying in carriers on the floor because Stokes hadn't bought enough cribs. Rollins wrote in her notes that one infant had been neglected for so long that \"urine had soaked through its outer garment as it sat on the carpet\" and electrical outlets in the kitchen didn't have childproof plugs or cover plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Reveal reports that they could find no evidence that Stokes's church — which she founded — holds services or performs outreach. The site's investigation also found at least 80 daycare operators who suddenly decided to identify as religious after regulators tried to shut them down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Stokes is running a church daycare called Little Nemo's, next to an auto repair shop, that is at least her 12th operation. All she had to do to open her doors was tell regulators was that her daycare was \"an integral part\" of her church.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is hope for parents who are appalled by what Stokes and similar daycare owners have been using religion to circumvent regulations. Yesterday, Alabama lawmaker Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham introduced a bill to overturn the state's religious exemption for faith-based daycares, citing the Reveal investigation's findings.\n",

      "\n",
      "A 200-mile EV would give Ford a product to compete against the hotly anticipated 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, and the upcoming second generation of the Nissan Leaf. Executives explained that they’ve ruled out building such a vehicle for the time being because achieving 200 miles on a single charge would require a battery pack that’s big, heavy, and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Ford’s next all-electric car is a comprehensively revised version of the Focus Electric. It will arrive this fall with a 100-mile range, about 25 more than the model that’s currently found in showrooms. That’s not much on paper, and certainly not when the Bolt promises to drive for at least 200 miles between plug-ins, but Ford believes it’s enough to satisfy the needs of most buyers who are in the market for a compact electric car.\n",

      "“I think right now with the launch of the Focus Electric at 100 miles, it is going to satisfy a big chunk of the population.

Recent rumors indicate Ford is in the early stages of developing a dedicated hybrid model that will fight in the same segment as the Toyota Prius and the recently-introduced Hyundai Ioniq. The car could be called Model E, and it will likely be built alongside the next-generation Focus in Mexico starting in 2019.\n"

      "Prince Will Be Missed — And So Will His Masterful Shade\n",
      "Prince, who died Thursday at the age of 57, was a legendary artist. And while he was known mainly for his enormous musical talent, there is another, more subtle art that Prince will be remembered for — his shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Favorite Prince memories: his effortless shade. #RIPPrince\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince in heaven right now throwing shade. \"Nice sandals, Jesus\"pic.twitter.com/t9R2m8av2G\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dorien Corey defines it in the classic 1980s documentary Paris Is Burning: \"Shade is 'I don't tell you you're ugly, but I don't have to tell you, because you know you're ugly.' And that's shade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince's shade often came without words. With a mere look, he could convey immense disapproval, like when Alicia Keys hopped up onto a piano during a Prince tribute at the 2010 BET Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or Prince's wordless review of Trey Songz's segment of that same musical tribute:\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the infamous side eye at the Grammys in 2015 before he announced that albums \"like books and black lives\" matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or when he famously stayed silent at the 1995 American Music Awards when handed a mic during a performance of the multi-artist collaboration \"We Are the World,\" a charity single that Prince famously declined to join. Instead, he offered Quincy Jones some of his lollipop.\n",
      "\n",
      "And sometimes, Prince did speak that shade. Like when he made this comment on The Tavis Smiley Show about people who lip sync:\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 1pic.twitter.com/VacDcGsTQS\n",

      "Tesla's Elon Musk Unveils a Factory He Hopes Will Change the World\n",
      "Few people have the ability to get a room full of people pumped up—and so overcome with excitement that they shout out affirmations of “Yes!” and “woohoo!”—about manufacturing. But that’s what happened Friday night as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and co-founder and CTO JB Straubel addressed the company’s biggest fans at a “grand opening” of its massive, and still-under-construction battery factory outside Reno, Nevada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invite-only event, parts of which were broadcast live July 29, followed a press tour earlier this week at the massive complex being built in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m really excited about revitalizing manufacturing,” Musk said to the crowd of VIPs, customers, and some of the company’s earliest investors. “It needs love, and we’re going to give it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gigafactory is critically important for the company; it’s the cornerstone to all of what Tesla (tsla) hopes to achieve: To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The factory is expected to reduce the per-kilowatt-hour cost of Tesla lithium-ion battery packs by more than 30%, which will in turn drive down the cost for its electric vehicles. Without the factory, Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 won’t be possible—at least not for $35,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, a lot is riding on the success of the gigafactory. In a video of the grand opening event, which you can check out below, the excitement and intensity of Musk, Straubel, and the crowd is palpable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factory, which will cost at least $5 billion to build, was only 14% completed when Fortune reporter Katie Fehrenbacher got a tour of the facility on Tuesday. But even at just one-seventh complete, the factory and grounds still seemed monstrous.\n",
      "\n",
      "And big it will be. The footprint of the completed factory is 6 million square feet, a size that could accommodate 93 Boeing 747 jets, or—according to Musk—50 billion hamsters. That’s a lot of hamsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk’s Mention of a 90-Year-Old Book Broke the Internet\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s about making enough electric cars, enough stationary battery packs that it actually moves the needle from a global carbon production perspective—that it actually does really change the world,” Musk said, explaining the purpose behind the gigafactory. “It has to be big because the world is big.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2018, the factory will hit its initial goal of producing 50 gigawatt hours of battery packs a year, the amount required to make about 500,000 electric cars annually, not to mention its energy storage product Powerwall. When the factory is fully built out, it will have the ability to make 150 gigawatt hours of battery packs a year, enough for 1.5 million electric vehicles, according to Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There just wasn’t enough factory capacity anywhere else in the world,” said Straubel, explaining why the company decided to build the gigafactory. “We didn’t have an option.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s not just about building a big factory. The art and science of manufacturing is how to thoughtfully design and lay out every detail and component within it to be able to make more goods as efficiently and cheaply as possible without making compromises on quality. Other companies, notably Toyota, have been working towards that efficiency sweet spot for decades. What makes the Tesla gigafactory special is the sheer size of the building and the company’s dogged pursuit of optimizing the density of useful stuff within it, in spite of its size.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tesla’s secret manufacturing plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the premise behind the “machine that builds the machine“—an idea that Musk talks about often, including in the video, and that he is clearly fascinated, and maybe even a little obsessed with. In this case, that obsession could help the company push battery prices even lower and squeeze even more production capacity out of the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla has pushed the idea of the machine that builds the machine to a point where it hopes to produce 150 gigawatt hours of batteries in the same volumetric space as the original design, according to Musk.\n",

      "Making his debut appearance on Hillary Clinton’s campaign trail, Vice President Joe Biden said GOP nominee Donald Trump “would have loved Stalin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This guy’s shame has no limits,” Biden told a crowd in his hometown of Scranton, PA. He noted that Trump, at a news conference last month, urged Russia to conduct a cyber attack against America when he invited Russian hackers to find and publish emails Clinton says she were deleted because they were personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] emails that are missing,” Trump said at a press conference. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. … That’ll be nice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Associated Press\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if he is joking – which he is not – that’s an outrageous thing to say,” Biden said this afternoon at the Clinton rally which was covered by the cable news outlets, though Fox News Channel broke away before Biden really got rolling on Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has expressed admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin and “showered praise on Saddam Hussein, a man who repeatedly backed terrorist attacks against Israel,” Biden told the receptive crowd of Clinton supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The veep blasted Trump for telling a Florida crowd last week that President Obama founded ISIS. “That’s an outrageous statement,” Biden scoffed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump last Wednesday called Obama “the founder of ISIS,” later adding that Clinton co-founded the terrorist group. Trump said Friday that his assertion was sarcasm lost on CNN,but later that same day said his claim, while sarcasm, was “not that sarcastic.”\n",

      "“Let me tell you why it’s a dangerous statement,” Biden warned today. “The bad guys are listening.”\n",

      "Said Biden: “If my son were still in Iraq, and I say to all of those who are there, the threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks … as a consequence of Trump’s outlandish comments,” which have hurt the “physical safety of our troops” and already “made our country less safe.\n",

      "“Hillary has forgotten more about American foreign policy than Trump and his entire team will ever understand.”\n",

      "He added: “I can say without hesitation … no major party nominee in the history of the United States of America has known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security than Donald Trump,” Biden insisted. “And what absolutely amazes me is that he doesn’t seem to want to learn it. … He doesn’t think it matters.”\n",

      "Monday morning (Aug. 1), Baltimore police officers entered Korryn Shandawn Gaines’ apartment building with the intent of carrying out arrest warrants on Gaines and an unidentified male. What ensued was a shoot out that left a woman dead, a child injured and a police department treading carefully through an onslaught of questions and speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reportedly, a bench warrant for Gaines’ arrest had been issued following her failure to appear in court to face charges related to cases of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest following a traffic stop back in March. The unidentified male was wanted on assault charges. After identifying themselves and knocking on the door of her apartment for a period of time, officers acquired the key to Gaines’ apartment from her landlord and opened the door to find themselves face to face with the barrel of the long gun Gaines reportedly wielded at them while seated on the floor holding her 5-year-old son.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to Baltimore County Police Spokesperson Elise Armacost, the building was evacuated and officers engaged in an hours-long stand off with Gaines as they tried to negotiate with her. Armacost says that Gaines continuously threatened officers verbally with her weapon pointed at them. Following the threats, an officer fired at Gaines, she fired several shots back, which were returned with more shots from officers, this time striking the 23-year-old multiple times and killing her. Her 5-year-old son which she was holding was injured during the encounter, but is said to have non-life threatening wounds and is expected to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Gaines now deceased and the officers in question on administrative leave, there is speculation circulating without much resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armacost says it is unclear if the officers were wearing body cameras at the time of the encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our body camera program is just a few weeks old,” she said. “We are looking to see whether any officers involved in this case was wearing a camera, but only a few officers are wearing them at this point.”\n",

      "According to the New York Daily News, the teenager called 911 around 1:30 a.m., to confess his actions.

The married pair also had their two other children inside the home, a son, 20, and a teenage daughter. Reports state they were unharmed.\n",

      "If you want a Jolteon, name your Eevee \"Sparky.\" If you want a Vaporeon, name it \"Rainer.\" If you want a Flareon, go with \"Pyro.\" These are the names of the OG Eevee brothers who appeared early on in the cartoon series.

And after a look at his selections, one thing is for sure: The man has an interesting taste in music.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are technically two playlists, one for day and one for night, and both seem like they actually had some thought put into them. He could have easily had some staffer slap together a list of hit summer jams, but that’s not what this is. The daytime playlist in particular is fascinating with President Obama choosing Courtney Barnett! It’s enough to make you forgive him for including the somewhat basic “Home” by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. Daytime also includes artists such as Wale, Janelle Monae, Prince, Common, and Gary Clark Jr.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nighttime list has many a fine selection as well. You’ve got D’Angelo and Chance the Rapper and Miles Davis. That being said, one song jumps out. President Obama is into “Criminal” by Fiona Apple. One, that just feels like baiting Donald Trump. Two, can you imagine a sitting President of the United States watching the music video for that song? For what it’s worth, if things go south following this upcoming election, Obama might have to agree with Fiona about what this world would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it’s a solid collection of tracks, and one imagines next summer he’ll have the time to put together an even more impressive playlist, perhaps ranking among one of the best you can find on Spotify.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, Clinton joined Lena Dunham and America Ferrera for a Facebook Live event with Glamour's editor in chief, Cindi Leive, who brought up Ivanka's speech at the GOP Convention last week, \"in which she essentially painted her father as the Gloria Steinem of the Republican party.\" Citing the fact that the nominee's daughter said Donald Trump \"would fight for equal pay for equal work\" and \"focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all,\" Leive asked Clinton, \"If you got to ask her a question about how her father would do that, what would it be?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The 107-page guide was posted on enthusiast site Camaro6.com, ahead of an official General Motors announcement of the final specs. When GM unveiled the ZL1 at the 2016 New York Auto Show back in March, it quoted figures of 640 hp and 640 lb-ft of torque. It’s always nice when 10 hp and 10 lb-ft materialize seemingly out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means the ZL1 now matches the output for the Corvette Z06, with which it shares a 6.2-liter supercharged LT4 V8 engine.GM apparently isn’t worried about the Camaro stealing the Corvette’s thunder, or overshadowing the Cadillac CTS-V luxury sedan. That car also uses the LT4 engine, but is rated at 640 hp and 630 lb-ft. The ZL1 also debuts a new 10-speed automatic co-developed with Ford, while the Corvette and Caddy use eight-speed autos. The Corvette is also available with a seven-speed manual, while the ZL1 uses a six-speed.\n",

The 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi Hellcat may still be the most powerful muscle car engine, but the ZL1 will likely be the more well rounded of the two. The lighter Camaro body and more sophisticated suspension should the ZL1 a better track car, even if it won’t win every drag race.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ZL1 uses GM’s Magnetic Ride suspension, which includes magnetorheological dampers filled with fluid impregnated with iron filings that can adjusted near-instantaneously by running a current through it. GM also claims the ZL1 will be fully track ready from the factory, thanks to features like 11 standard heat exchangers.

      "What the Clintons' tax return tells us about Hillary\n",
      "Donald Trump has said he fights \"very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\" The same could not be said of Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton released her 2015 federal income tax return on Friday in a move to pressure Trump to release his returns. As a couple, Hillary and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, deducted $2.24 million last year, and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's white-bread stuff. Hillary has been running for president for decades and her tax returns show it,\" said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts and author of the \"Politics of Federal Taxation\" column for Tax Notes magazine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What the return shows is a document prepared in a way to leave little to scrutiny. In other words, no mysterious deductions, or profits from trading in cattle futures. And it would seem every effort was made to show a higher effective tax rate to underscore a couple paying their fair share. In other words, a tax return filed by two people used to the enormous magnifying glass of public life.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would have to go back to Gerald Ford to find a major presidential candidate who paid a higher effective federal tax rate than Clinton, Thorndike said. During the Ford administration, the top federal income tax rate was 70 percent.\n",

      "On Saturday, Australia's Mack Horton won gold in the men's 400-meter freestyle, dethroning China's Sun Yang, who won silver, to take top spot on the podium. But while the competition was fierce in the water, the bigger fight between the two is actually happening on dry land — and it's starting to get very dirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, Yang tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine during the Chinese nationals and was suspended from swimming for three months. Yang insisted he was prescribed the drug to help with heart palpitations, but Horton clearly never bought it, and has made his feelings about doping very clear in multiple press interviews leading up to and during the Olympics. To make matters worse, during a training session prior to the Olympics, Yang allegedly splashed some water into Horton's lane, which the swimmer took as a personal attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He just kind of splashed me, but I ignored him because I don't have time or respect for drug cheats,\" Horton said following the preliminary heats this weekend, according to the Washington Post. \"He wasn't too happy about that, so he kept splashing me. I just got in and did my thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This very uncomfortable handshake says everything. Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "After Horton won the gold Sunday, however, things started to get even more heated between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just have a problem with athletes who have tested positive and are still competing,\" Horton said at the press conference following the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Yang — who was awkwardly sitting right next to him — responded by saying, \"On the competition stage, every athlete deserves to be respected, and there's no need to use these sort of cheap tricks to affect each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the same conference, when confronted by the Chinese media as to why he attacked Yang by calling him a drug cheat, Horton doubled down on his original sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used the words drug cheat because he tested positive,\" he said, calling his win \"a win for the good guys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know if it's a rivalry between me and him, just me and athletes who have tested positive,\" he continued, according to the Washington Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, fans of Yang were not too pleased by the spat, and Horton's social media soon became flooded with snake emojis and commenters demanding he apologize to Yang for his remarks. Superfans of Yang were especially vicious due to the fact Yang was seen crying after losing his title — and it got so bad, Horton shut down comments on his Instagram altogether. Even China's media attacked the Australian swimmer, directly calling his home country \"uncivilized\" and his victory \"disgraceful,\" according to Yahoo News.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Australian media and officials have stuck by Horton's side, and the Australian Olympic Committee released a statement this weekend stating, \"He has spoken out in support of clean athletes. This is something he feels strongly about and good luck to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Horton and Yang will be competing against one another again next Saturday for the men's 1,500-meter free, for which Yang is both the world record holder and defending gold medalist.\n",

      "According to the criminal complaint, the sophomore was in Domres' English class, where they became fast friends, and texted each other frequently, the police report stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "During their relationship, lasting between April 2015 and January 2016, they reportedly exchanged over 1,100 messages. One of the many text messages said, \"I love being your baby boo. (heart emoji) run away with me!!! I want you forever,\" according to the criminal complaint.\n",

      "According to police, a message was sent the night before: \"You're extremely attractive to me!!! I can't wait for our night we are doing it no matter what!!!\"\n",

      "The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Domres was married in August, in the midst of her relationship with the student.\n",

      "The Dirtiest Soccer Player in the Known Universe\n",
      "Because never does a man stand so tall as when he stoops to stomp on the hand of a man in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a twisted delight to be had in watching Real Madrid’s oft-injured central defender sensation, Képler Laveran Lima Ferreira, or Pepe, do what he does best. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing for Portugal against Germany, Pepe walked away, leaving Thomas Müller on the ground, a victim of the sport’s frequent and unavoidable collisions. Pepe’s heart, very possibly full of concern for the welfare of a fallen compatriot, returned to where Müller sat and leaned down, not so much to offer a helping hand as to head-butt Müller with all of his might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pepe was subsequently red-carded and his team lost 0-4, but his point had been made: There would be no dirtier player in soccer in the known universe. Not if he could help it, and he most certainly could. You see, in a history that could just as easily be the history of the red card — a penalty designator for those not familiar with the rules of the “gentle sport” — the Brazilian Pepe cuts a dirty swath across the playing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tactics have ranged from stomping on the hand of a downed Lionel Messi in 2012 — unintentionally, Pepe claimed — to his 2009 pièce de résistance: knocking down an opposing midfielder in the penalty area, then kicking the fallen opponent twice before being yanked away from him, only to return to push his head into the field while stomping on him. Pepe then proceeded to punch another player in the face. All in a day’s work.\n",
      "\n",
      "His reward? A 10-game season-ending ban. His response? Probably very much like it was in a 2012 incident where Pepe braced a ref in the locker room, calling him “a rip-off motherfucker.” Suspension in that case? Two games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guys like this are typically adored by the home supporters but furiously hated by the rest,” says Kristian Dávid, an 18-year vet of the game (striker and sometime left winger) and a coach for Swedish teams. “But in general, guys like Pepe are good to have, to be honest. Just to be able to get your opponents off-balance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Pepe (whose management declined to make him available for comment) joins a rogues’ gallery that includes 27-year-old Diego Costa (the “most disliked man in football,” according to British press), Zlatan Ibrahimović (kicked a teammate in the face while the teammate was being interviewed on-camera) and Hall of Famer Vinnie Jones, who has since gone on to a film career. Jones’ usual roles? Guys who beat other guys to bits, naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not so much the fact that these guys are just fucking shit up that I like,” says Kevin Conahan, a radio DJ and 18-year soccer vet. “Well, actually, it is that.” That, and probably that anyone willing to play a long-haul game like soccer as though it’s a life-and-death endeavor, deserves being paid attention to.\n",

In 1930, amid the stock market crash, Jones completed the greatest year in golf ever, winning all four major tournaments in the calendar year. At that time, the Grand Slam consisted of the British Amateur, British Open, U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur. The closest any golfer has been to the mark since was in 1953, when Ben Hogan won the first three.\n",

      "Tiger Woods didn't even give the field at chance at the 2000 U.S. Open. Woods won the event by a ridiculous major-record 15 shots, two better than the one set by Old Tom Morris at the 1862 British Open.\n",

      "Thwarting a Kansas group comprised of parents and students that opposed the state’s adoption of a national science curriculum, a federal court has upheld a lower court’s ruling on a case involving the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Back in 2013, the Citizens for Objective Public Education (COPE), a religiously oriented group, sued to block the curriculum, claiming that the new standards constituted a form of “religious indoctrination.” According to COPE, NGSS’s failure to include a religious basis for the origins of life and the universe makes the curriculum unsuitable for the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "COPE’s lawsuit hinged upon the notion that the scientific view promoted by the NGSS curriculum is tacitly anti-religious, thereby violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. By not mentioning God’s involvement in the beginning of mankind, COPE says, Kansas schools are instead advancing a non-religious standard, “establishing” a non-religion. The Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, however, rejected this claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“COPE does not offer any facts to support the conclusion that the Standards condemn any religion or send a message of endorsement,” the court concluded. “And any fear of biased instruction is premised on COPE’s predictions of school districts’ responses to the Standards — an attempt by COPE to recast a future injury as a present one.”\n",

      "In the early 1860s, Mexico had fallen in immense debt to France. That situation led Napoleon III, who had flirted with supporting the confederacy, to send troops to not only overtake Mexico City, but also to help form a Confederate-friendly country that would neighbor the South.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The French army was about four days from Mexico City when they had to go through the town of Puebla, and as it happened, they didn’t make it,” Hayes-Bautista says. In a David-and-Goliath style triumph, the smaller and less-equipped Mexican army held off French troops in the Battle of Puebla, on the fifth of May of 1862. (The French army returned the following year and won, but it was the initial Mexican victory was still impressive.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until May 27 that the news of the Battle of Puebla finally reached California-based Latinos, who had been feeling disheartened as Union forces were falling, quite disastrously so, to Robert E. Lee’s Confederate troops. The news from Mexico was doubly good for that population: not only was Mexico victorious, but California—as a free state—was also glad for the failure of the French plan to help the Confederacy. This was particularly true for residents of Hispanic origin, who had particular reason to oppose the South’s system of white supremacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hayes-Bautista cites Major Jose Ramon Pico, a general who organized Spanish-speaking cavalries to fight alongside the Union in the Civil War, as a prime example of what was at stake for some Latinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His grandmother was listed as Mulato in the 1790 census,” he says. “He came from an African-Mexican family, so he organized troops to fight for freedom and [linked] the Civil War to the French intervention in Mexico.”\n",

      "“By the time [Latinos in California] heard about the news of the battle, they began to raise money for the Mexican troops and they formed a really important network of patriotic organizations,” says Jose Alamillo, a professor of Chicano studies at California State University Channel Islands. “They had to kind of make the case for fighting for freedom and democracy and they were able to link the struggle of Mexico to the struggle of the Civil War, so there were simultaneous fights for democracy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until much later that the holiday took on the party-friendly connotations for which it’s known today. “The 1970s and ’80s really is when the U.S. beer companies began to kind of look for ways to target the Spanish-speaking population,” Alamillo says.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, despite the holiday’s marketing-fueled transformation into a time for drinking, it’s unique origins can still be seen in the way it’s celebrated—or, rather, the way it’s not. Alamillo, who was born in Zacatecas, Mexico, and moved to America when he was 8 years old, says he didn’t learn about Cinco de Mayo until his American elementary-school education.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought, ‘Why would I hear about it in a classroom in the U.S., but my parents and uncles never heard about it in their schooling in Mexico?'” he says. “It’s not a Mexican holiday, not an American holiday, but an American-Mexican holiday.”\n",

I drafted a two-page message to her, filled with apologies and sincere dismay at having to be the bearer of bad news, but I still had doubts over whether it was my place to tell her. A small part of me believed that it was none of my business. Still, this was the first time I had encountered this kind of situation and I simply didn't know what was the morally right thing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends all rallied around me and supported me telling his girlfriend. \"Wouldn't you want to know?\" they asked. \"I would!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with doubts still lingering in my mind but quieted a lot by my friends, I sent the message. Nothing happened for two days. I sat on the edge of my seat, nervously waiting for a response. I hoped that she would thank me for telling her the truth. I imagined that she would be cool and polite and say she was going to break up with him now. He would be the ultimate loser in this situation when we both dumped him. It was very John Tucker Must Die, in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, of course, didn't happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day after sending the message, I received a horrible, hated-filled email that condemned me for sleeping with him, even though I did it unknowingly. If I felt awful before, this definitely multiplied that feeling. Alan also texted me, telling me I was a terrible person for trying to break them up even though I didn't want anything to do with him anymore. At that point, I thankfully moved. I didn't communicate with either Alan or his girlfriend again. But I later heard that he and his girlfriend ended up staying together.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the first time I hooked up with someone else's boyfriend. It wasn't the last, but it was the last time I felt that guilty and responsible to right the \"wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't go around looking to hook up with unavailable men, but I'm tired of my friends telling me I should feel guilty about hooking up with someone else's boyfriend. I shouldn't be the one who feels guilt or a responsibility to monitor other people's relationships. I shouldn't bear the burden of having to ask if he is single, or taken, or in a complicated situation. It is his job to avoid hooking up with anyone if he is unavailable. I came to this conclusion after two men didn't tell me they were in a relationship and after my own personal experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years ago, I was the girlfriend whose boyfriend cheated on her and had the other woman tell me. It was probably the worst emotional pain I've ever felt. The sadder part is that I continued dating the guy who cheated on me for another year! I didn't trust him ever again, though, and that poisoned the relationship into a slow death.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I blamed the other woman. She enticed him. She knew he wasn't single. She still went for it. I focused all the hate and blame on her for months and it was oh so easy to pardon my boyfriend's behavior. Then I realized the hypocrisy of my own thoughts. My boyfriend was the one who was supposed to be monogamous to me, not her. Even if she enticed him with every seductive tool in her belt, he still made the ultimate decision to cheat on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you are in a relationship with someone, you both enter into a monogamous — or whatever you decide — agreement. You make promises to each other. And that contract is solely between you two. The third person has nothing to do with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone makes the choice to cheat, that is the person in the relationship's fault, not the outsider. They were the one who broke the promise to their partner. But it is all too common to blame the third party , like my experience with Alan's girlfriend, and my own previous relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it becomes all too easy to shift the blame completely to the \"Other Person.\" I felt better when I did it. I loved my boyfriend at time and didn't want to see him as someone with such a capacity to hurt me. It was so much easier to see a stranger as the villain. But I don't think that is fair. Because she was a stranger, she didn't owe me anything. He did.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I don't worry about guys' relationship status. I don't plan on actively seeking unavailable men — not really my thing — but I don't take on the burden of trying to discern the truth. My default assumption is, if you are flirting or hitting on me or wanting to hookup, then you are single. If I find out otherwise, it isn't my business, and I don't feel guilty for your decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I hook up with your boyfriend, don't expect me to feel bad. I probably didn't do it on purpose, but even if I did, he is the one who betrayed your trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Place the blame where it belongs — on the cheater.\n",

      "\n",
      "But after examining Sunday’s events more closely, a government minister on Thursday speculated that rather than a drone, the object may have actually been a plastic bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there’ve been hundreds of apparent near misses between planes and drones over the last couple of years, initial news reports regarding the recent Heathrow incident suggested an actual collision had taken place for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aircraft, a British Airways Airbus A320 with 132 passengers on board, landed safely. The pilot had said that as the plane came in on its final approach, it hit what may have been a drone flying at an altitude of about 1,700 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a search on the ground failed to turn up any debris, government minister Robert Goodwill appeared keen to play down the incident, urging other officials not to overreact with calls for swift legislation to further tighten rules on drone use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill told a government committee it wasn’t certain that a drone strike had taken place, adding that there’s “some speculation that it may have even been a plastic bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister also said that “early reports of a dent in the front of the plane” appeared to be inaccurate as “no actual damage” was found during an inspection of the aircraft.\n",

      "Philip Morris uses chemical industry consultants to perpetuate 'light cigarette' myth\n",
      "In reality, scientific evidence that cigarettes cause cancer was becoming overwhelming. In 1964, the Surgeon General seemed to put an end to any controversy when he released the report of an independent advisory committee that had considered more than 7,000 published articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Surgeon General’s warning had a profound effect on the public, prompting many smokers to quit. But the tobacco companies and their scientists would continue to deny that cigarettes cause cancer for another 35 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "To discourage smokers from quitting, companies redesigned their cigarettes to seem safer. First, they added filters. Then they introduced “low-tar” cigarettes. Within a few years, these cigarettes dominated the market. Marlboro Lights, which debuted in 1971, became the nation’s best-selling cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tobacco companies knew from extensive internal research that smokers were addicted to nicotine and needed a certain amount of it every day to satisfy their habit. Given a “low-tar” cigarette, they would change the way they smoked to get their fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the passage of a new law, the Federal Trade Commission in 1967 began testing all cigarette brands on special smoking machines that measured the amount of tar inhaled. Cigarettes were reformulated, not so much to reduce tar but to fool the machines, according to a National Cancer Institute report. Tiny holes were cut in the cigarette paper to vent tar when a cigarette was smoked by a machine. Those holes, however, didn’t reduce the tar inhaled by smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you reduce the amount of nicotine coming through, the person changes a pattern of it. They take bigger puffs, they take deeper puffs, they take longer puffs, they smoke more cigarettes per day to get the amount of nicotine they are seeking to satisfy their addiction,” said Dr. David Burns, a retired medical professor at the University of California, San Diego, who edited some of the Surgeon General’s reports on smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns was testifying for the plaintiffs in a recent St. Louis class-action trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also testifying was William Farone, the research director at Philip Morris from 1977 to 1984. He said studies done at the company even before he was hired showed that smokers who switched to light cigarettes would take deeper puffs to get the same amount of nicotine they’d received from regular ones. Farone said other than those tiny holes in the paper, the differences between a Marlboro Red and a Marlboro Light were small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public-health scientists would not figure this out for several more years. A study by the American Cancer Society published in 1995 found that the rate of lung cancer deaths among 200,000 smokers actually went up after light cigarettes began dominating sales. Experts believe that the low-burning temperature of a low-tar cigarette and deeper puffs by smokers allow more carcinogens to go deeper into the lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Corrective statements’ ordered\n",
      "\n",
      "The rewards for disputing the scientific consensus are high while the risks are low. The Justice Department’s racketeering lawsuit had sought to have the tobacco industry repay illegal profits of $480 billion. But an appellate court ruled that federal racketeering laws didn’t allow for fines for past behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Kessler’s only power was to order cigarette makers to stop engaging in illegal behavior. Companies appealed her order to quit making claims about low-tar cigarettes, arguing it violated their First Amendment rights. But Kessler’s ruling was upheld.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Philip Morris hired scientists from the consulting firms Gradient Corp. and Ramboll Environ to testify in lawsuits that so-called low-tar cigarettes are safer than regular ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharon Eubanks, the former Justice Department attorney who led the lawsuit, believes Philip Morris is violating Kessler’s order. The order forbids public statements declaring that low-tar cigarettes have health benefits, even if such statements come from a Philip Morris consultant.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enforce the order, the Justice Department would have to file a motion with Kessler. A department spokesman would not comment on the case. Calls to Philip Morris seeking comment were not returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the case wound through appeals, Kessler issued a revised opinion and order in February reiterating that tobacco companies must make the following “corrective statements” on their websites and in advertising:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many smokers switch to low-tar and light cigarettes rather than quitting because they think low-tar and light cigarettes are less harmful. They are not .\n",
      "\n",
      ". “Low tar” and “light” cigarette smokers inhale essentially the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "All cigarettes cause cancer, lung disease, heart attacks, and premature death — lights, low tar, ultra lights, and naturals. There is no safe cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "A decade after the original order, and five years after Kessler first issued these statements, tobacco companies are still appealing her ruling. None has printed the statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress agreed with Kessler’s original findings, and in 2009 passed a law also forbidding the tobacco companies from calling cigarettes “light” or “low-tar” without the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But Philip Morris says research done since Kessler’s 2006 order justifies the company’s claims that such cigarettes are safer than regular ones.\n",

      "This week on NCIS, the case of a couple of Phony Tonys quite possibly planted a seed for how the very real, Very Special Agent DiNozzo will leave in the Season 13 finale aka Michael Weatherly‘s final episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the trail of a some identity thieves, DiNozzo eventually confronts the Phony Tonys, who had been hired, as actors, by none other than the woman that Tony bungled a hot date with a few episodes back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The imposter dubbed “Short Tony” says he was enticed by the idea of posing as a Jason Bourne-type government agent, but instead got “Jason Boring.” Tall Tony chimes in that “learning his lines” as DiNozzo was easy since, as they tell the real deal, “You have no life. No wife, no kids, no hobbies, same job, same apartment… Nothing changes with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, DiNozzo is led to ruminate about his love life, when Abby discovers the lengths to which he goes to woo women such as “Leah.” “You’re a catch,” Abby declares, to which Tony shrugs, “Maybe I just haven’t met the right one yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The introspection didn’t end there, not by a long shot. After being pulled over and hauled in by a cop for speeding/posing as a federal agent, DiNozzo tells McGee that he did “a lot of thinking in the big house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel like my life is a charade,” Tony laments. Recounting how he got easily swindled by “Leah,” he asks Tim, “You’d tell me, right, if I was losing my edge, the DiNozzo edge? Because I feel like it.” Worse, he feels like a “buffoon,” he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes feel like I don’t know who I am… like I’ve already lost my identity,” he continues. “Is [the identity theft] some weird metaphor for my psychological state?”\n",
      "\n",
      "All of which would seem to suggest a restless DiNozzo, someone poised to transform his “Jason Boring” “charade” of a life into something meaningful. Possibly by way of a new job, or… something more? After all, he did note that (his goldfish) Ziva “gained a little weight” — which surely at least a few out there will read as a planted seed of a whole other kind.\n",

      "White House Comes To Larry Wilmore’s Rescue Over Correspondents’ Dinner Speech Controversy\n",
      "President Barack Obama “appreciated the spirit of Mr. Wilmore’s expressions” used at Saturday’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and insisted that “any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the president as the butt of a joke,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted today at his press briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilmore has been under fire, in some quarters, for the way in which he wound up his speech at the annual Nerd Prom. The Comedy Central late-night star said that when he was growing up, “a black man was thought by his mere color not good enough to lead a football team — and now, to live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the entire free world, words alone can do me no justice. So, Mr. President, if I’m going to keep it 100: Yo, Barry, you did it, my n*gga. You did it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those blasting Wilmore was WaPo’s editorial board member Jonathan Capehart, who is black. “Sure, there were and are blacks who loved what Wilmore said,” he wrote this morning. “They think that by ‘keeping it 100,’ a latter-day ‘keeping it real,’ Wilmore expressed the undeniable pride African Americans have for Obama, the first lady and everything the first family means and represents to them. But the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was neither Wilmore’s barbershop nor his momma’s house. Obama is president of the United States and should have been accorded the respect that comes with the office — especially by someone who considers himself family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Politico, in posting video of “Larry Wilmore’s Full Remarks at The White House Correspondents’ Dinner” cuts off after “To live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the entire free world, words alone can do me no justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked today about Obama’s reax to Wilmore’s speech final punchline, Earnest said: “I’m confident that Mr. Wilmore used the word by design. He was seeking to be provocative.”\n",

      "Wilmore’s closing line wasn’t the only one that caused the Hinkley Hilton crowd to set up and take notice, though it was by far his most provocative.

      "Ducati’s Scrambler Sixty2 Hipster Marketing Might Make You Puke\n",
      "According to whichever New York marketing agency Ducati hired to launch its Scrambler brand, if you are considering said motorcycle it follows that you are a young man of exacting taste. You spend weekends riding across sweeping Baja dunes, gritting your teeth against the sand, while by night you sip craft bourbon at a crackling campfire as a voluptuous female silhouette bends over in the distance. You favor buffalo plaid, fulsome facial hair experiments, and meticulously frayed designer jeans. Your eclectic—but well-considered!—tattoo collection would certainly be endorsed as a \"DO\" by VICE magazine. Your life, in other words, is one long Steve McQueen reverie as seen through vintage-inspired Warby Parker goggles; you have achieved Silver Lake Nirvana. But here's the thing: despite the image Ducati desperately wants to sell you, a motorcycle is not some sort of antidote for disintegrating self-identity, or a panacea for the doldrums of cubicle living. A motorcycle is a machine—one of the purest, most utilitarian machines left on the modern market, second only to a chainsaw, or maybe a nail gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, all marketing is based on the appropriation of identity, but Ducati doesn’t have to lean so heavily on those wispy illusions when promoting their new Scrambler Sixty2. Especially because the Sixty2 happens to be so damn good. Ducati’s Scrambler, which they debuted not just as a motorcycle but as a standalone sub-brand last year, was constructed with the focused goal of adding an entirely new demographic to their sales. Ducati is mostly known for exceptional Italian-built steeds of pure speed and mouthwatering design; its halo Panigale superbike is a 200-mph, petrol-fueled sculpture, with the sort of Bologna-bred beauty that makes grown men teary-eyed and weak in the knees. But the company needed a motorcycle that could usher in a new age of Ducatisti, a bike that riders just getting into the two-wheeled lifestyle could embrace without fear of squandering their mortgage. By all measures, and as one of the most highly-lauded motorcycles of 2015, the Scrambler Icon achieved this very goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ducati\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2016, Ducati introduced the Scrambler Sixty2. They modified the 800cc motor in last year’s Icon model down to 400cc, decreasing not only displacement but also horsepower and torque (to 41 hp and 25.3 lb-ft, down from 75 hp and 50 lb-ft). While the idea of decreasing power would be anathema to most skilled enthusiasts, the goal was to create a motorcycle that didn’t frighten first-time riders. The result is a superb beginner’s bike, silky smooth on throttle and absent of lurches (unlike the Icon, which could be a bit squirrely from a standstill). With a 31-inch seat height, even the vertically challenged can fearlessly throw a leg over. It's also light, and the riding position and high handlebars make the Sixty2 surprisingly comfortable and easy to maneuver. Plus, all of these attributes are wrapped in one of the best visual packages around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget to sign up Your Email Address\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginner bikes typically resemble ill-formed toys, with tiny engines loosely hanging on unattractive frames. But the Sixty2 looks like a full-grown motorcycle, partly because, size-wise, the Sixty2 has the same engine as the Icon. There’s a steel-trellis swingarm, Showa forks, LED lights all around, a teardrop gas tank, blacked-out silencers, LCD instruments, and knobby Pirelli tires. Don’t forget the Brembo brakes up front with ABS to keep you safe—a segment-exclusive technology that should be standard for beginners. The overall aesthetic is clean, minimal, throwback: a bike for noobs that will actually compliment your style. Some may think that doesn’t matter. Fair enough. But for those who care about their image, visual and otherwise, the Sixty2 succeeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ducati\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s where Ducati lost its way in marketing the bike. It’s one thing to care about how you dress or to have an opinion on Bell & Ross watches versus Shinola; it's another thing entirely to dummy down a motorcycle into a designer handbag for men (or women, for that matter, given the handful of female journos at the launch). There’s a point in the promo video where—and this is not a joke—a young girl sits in the lotus position in front of a Sixty2 while BMX bikes and skateboarders kickflip over them. It's the type of marketing bullshit where, were you unfortunate enough to find yourself in that meeting when the idea was first suggested, you just might have spit up your coffee. Either that or you would have proposed with a straight face that organic beard oil should be a shibboleth of the brand. Or maybe a Drake-approved app where you can learn to chicken dance.\n",

      "Cop, out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Series co-lead Stana Katic will not be a part of Castle Season 9, the victim of a cast shake-up that reportedly is designed to help cut costs for the aging procedural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources confirm for TVLine that which our sister site Deadline first reported, that Katic, whose one-year extension has expired, was not asked back for the fall (in the event the series gets renewed). Nor will longtime cast member Tamala Jones return as M.E. Lanie Parish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement on the situation, Katic said, “Rather then distract from what was an amazing experience, I would just like to say that I’m very grateful to ABC for giving me the opportunity to be a part of a much beloved show. Thank you to the fans.”\n",

      "\n",
      "ABC has confirmed both actresses’ exits, and issued this statement: “Kate Beckett has been a beloved character on our hit series Castle for the past eight years. We are grateful for Stana Katic’s talent and dedication to the series and we hope to continue our relationship. Tamala Jones has also been an integral part of the series and we are grateful she was a part of Castle.“\n",
      "\n",
      "How might Beckett be written out? In a new interview with TVLine, co-showrunner Alexi Hawley said that with both Katic’s and Nathan Fillion’s contracts up, the Season 8 finale airing May 16 ends “in a very dynamic way which leaves open the possibility that maybe the show won’t come back in the same form.” In that season ender, titled “Crossfire,” a twist in Rick and Kate’s final pursuit of the high-powered drug lord known as LokSat “puts their case — and their lives —in jeopardy,” seemingly allowing the series the option to kill off the intrepid NYPD police captain.\n",

      "Planet Earth is getting greener, and oddly enough, that’s probably not a good sign\n",
      "A new climate change study seems to suggest that a rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has helped plants propagate around the planet. The findings see contrarians (aka climate change skeptics) reasserting their claim that additional CO2 is beneficial for the planet, since foliage harness these emissions for growth. But the researchers behind the study, Greening of the Earth and its Drivers, insist the extra emissions and subsequent “fertilization effect” are more likely signs of a troubled system struggling to adjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tremendous amount of vegetated land has experienced greening, according to satellite data collected and analyzed by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries. The new greenery is equivalent to more than four billion giant sequoias. If all the extra leaves were laid flat, they’d cover the continental United States – twice! Added CO2 accounts for 70 percent of that growth, with climate change, increased nitrogen, and changes in land management accounting for fractions each. Despite global temperatures reaching a record high last year, only four percent of the world’s vegetated land has experienced depletion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to understand how contrarians would consider these findings evidence of the benefits of CO2 emissions. If plant greening were the sole concern, additional CO2 emissions would indeed be advantageous. But CO2 emissions have negative consequences that can ripple through the environment, disrupting the Earth’s feedback mechanisms that keep the system regulated.\n",

      "Related: With climate change in the spotlight, Google makes ‘largest purchase’ of renewable energy\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Philippe Ciais of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences rejects the contrarians’ position as single-minded. “The fallacy of the contrarian argument is two fold,” he told BBC News. “First, the many negative aspects of climate change are not acknowledged. Second, studies have shown that plants acclimatize to rising CO2 concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.” The study’s lead author, Professor Ranga Myneni of Boston University, added that extra greenery would not make up for the other effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and the loss of Arctic sea ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Professor Judith Curry, former chair of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, insists that scientists engage with the arguments of climate change skeptics. Speaking to BBC News, Curry said, against scientific consensus, the contrarians’ position “reflects conflicts of values and a preference for the empirical (i.e. what has been observed) versus the hypothetical (i.e. what is projected from climate models).” This conflict may likewise exist in the general public.\n",

      "A prosecutor in Alabama is calling a nearly 40-year-old man's marriage to his 18-year-old former student a \"sham\" to prevent her from testifying against him in a sex case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew Shane Wester — a 38-year-old former math teacher and one-time coach for both track and football at an Alabama high school — allegedly had sexual contact with one of his students back in 2014. According to AL.com, prosecutors indicted Wester in January 2015, alleging he \"intentionally and knowingly engaged with a male or female student under the age of 19 in sexual contact which was done for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party, to wit - kissing and spending the night with the victim.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Wester, who was married with a child at the time of the incident, resigned from his teaching position a month after the indictment, AL.com added. Last June, Wester, who divorced his wife a year ago, married the student, who has been identified as 18-year-old Amy Nicole Cox (Cox has previously shared photos of herself and Wester together, including one now widely-shared picture captioned \"happily married\"). But with the trial against Wester on the horizon at the time of their wedding, authorities are saying the marriage is simply a strategy to stop the teen from testifying against Wester in court — Alabama state law provides married couples with \"marital privilege,\" meaning they can't be forced to testify against each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "“We do not have a target. The number of animals depends on the bids we receive,” parks authority spokeswoman Caroline Washaya-Moyo said, according to Reuters. Zimbabwe’s national parks, although already cash-strapped, are known for their herds of elephant, wildebeests, wild buck and big cat predators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drought has exacerbated a dire economic situation in the country; Zimbabwe is yet to recover from a failed currency thanks to hyperinflation, international sanctions and corruption allegations.

      "The parks authority has sold animals previously to cope with financial pressures. Last year, Zimbabwe exported 20 elephants to China. Those beasts were taken from conservation parks and destined for zoos. International and local animal rights groups’ protests were ignored. Last year, the beloved Cecil the lion was killed by an American dentist in Zimbabwe, causing international outcry.\n",

      "Margot Robbie Says Harley Quinn Isn’t Wearing Hot Pants For You, or Is She?\n",
      "Harley Quinn's Suicide Squad hot pants have been an intensely debated topic. When actor Margot Robbie was asked about the costume again recently she said it made sense for the character but she wasn't always comfortable in it. Her words bring up the larger issues still surrounding women in Hollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a profile in the New York Times:\n",
      "\n",
      "As Harley Quinn, Ms. Robbie once again had to put much of her body on display: The character almost always wears tiny shorts and is seen, in one trailer, changing into a tight T-shirt. Ms. Robbie said she could justify the wardrobe: Her character is “wearing hot pants because they’re sparkly and fun,” she said, not because “she wanted guys to look at her ass.” But, she added: “As Margot, no, I don’t like wearing that. I’m eating burgers at lunchtime, and then you go do a scene where you’re hosed down and soaking wet in a white T-shirt, it’s so clingy and you’re self-conscious about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Australian actor is definitely aware of what she's dealing with when it comes to Hollywood. When discussing her work on Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street in 2014 with The Telegraph (You may recall Olivia Wilde was passed over for the role that went to Robbie because they thought she was too old, another bad trend in the business.), Robbie said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think nudity for the sake of nudity is shameful. If they’ve put it in just so that a girl gets her top off, then that’s disgusting. And you can always tell...The whole point of Naomi is that her body is her only form of currency in this world. So when Marty was trying to help me out, and said in the scene where she seduces Jordan perhaps I could have a robe on, I said she wouldn’t. She has to be naked. She’s laying her cards on the table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Robbie wasn't really ok with the idea of being nude on screen at all, even if it made sense for the character. In the NY Times piece, she makes sure to point out it's a give-and-take for her. “The sacrifice I have to make is that I have to do this nudity thing that I don’t really want to do. But I get to work with Scorsese, which I really want to do. O.K., what outweighs what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing things you don't want to do is an unfortunate reality for many women in Hollywood. Something many are struggling against constantly. It's not until you've made a name for yourself that you can feel comfortable saying no to things like nude scenes (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke can attest to this.). Sometimes it even takes creating your own production company (something Robbie is doing with LuckyChap Entertainment to develop her own projects) or getting executive producer credits to your name as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suicide Squad director David Ayer said to the NY Times of Harley's look, “I didn’t think denim overalls would be appropriate for that character” and Robbie got that it's \"part of the iconography.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to HelloGiggles earlier this year Robbie mentioned they did try Harley's original costume:\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, we tried on every variation of the costume. I cannot emphasis enough how many outfits, and how many variations of the Harley Quinn costume we tried. We tried the court jester costume, we tried the corset and skirt, we tried leather pants, we tried literally every type of costume possible for her. I really love where we ended up. And who knows, maybe in the sequels we’ll go with the court jester one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why didn't the creators go for a fuller costume, one that pays homage to her original depiction? What it likely boils down to is this: Hollywood and the heterosexual male gaze. Would Harley wear those shorts? Abso-freaking-lutely. (However, Ayer's “that’s part of the iconography\" doesn't work for Enchantress, a DC Comics character who has never dressed in so little as Cara Delevingne is in Suicide Squad.) But again, Harley's not supposed to be doing it for the audience, right? That's debatable, as one particular scene from the Suicide Squad trailer got our own Donna Dickens discussing how it looks to the audience to focus a camera on Robbie's buttocks as she bends over dramatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the sexy vs. sexually objectified argument. A lot of people love sexy (myself included), it's when a fictional character (or sometimes a real person) is sexually objectified that some people take issue, particularly when the subject has no agency. And the difference between the two is harder for a lot of people to grasp than you'd expect. But hell, 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit was way ahead of its time having Jessica Rabbit utter the line, \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The creator has control of the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's why some comic book covers featuring female characters are often critiqued. The majority of superhero comics are drawn for the heterosexual male gaze leading powerful female characters to be reduced to eye candy while male characters are depicted as the male power fantasy. The guys aren't depicted in costumes showing off every muscle because it's sexy to heterosexual women, they're meant to appeal to men who are drawn into the idea that being strong makes you a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Robbie's words say a lot about the continued state of the industry, there's another important part of the NY Times profile to consider:\n",

      "In March, North Carolina's legislature passed a controversial new law reversing the effects of a Charlotte ordinance that had previously protected the rights of individuals who identify as LGBT. Among other things, the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (better known as House Bill 2 or H.B. 2) made it illegal for transgender people to use public bathrooms that do not match the sex listed on their birth certificates, sparking national outrage and causing multiple corporations to boycott the state.\n",

      "In a recent essay for Mother Jones, Charlie Comero — a 35-year-old trans man who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina — explained how this law has affected him personally, and in the process, perfectly nailed why H.B. 2 makes it dangerous for trans individuals to use a public restroom in North Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where do I go to the bathroom now? It's literally against the law for me to use the men's room, and it's also risky,\" Comero writes. \"Even though I'm more than a year on testosterone — I'm getting facial hair, my hair has receded a little — I still don't always pass as male. Or do I use the women's room, follow the law, and clearly make people uncomfortable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The brilliant but heartbreaking way Comero has chosen to deal with the problem is by passing out cards that explain what he's doing in the women's bathroom. In fact, the idea went viral late last month — but, as he explains, the cards don't always work, because people don't always accept them.\n",

      "At this point, nothing Donald Trump says really surprises us — until it does. Last night on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah gave us a peek into “The Chronicles of Narcissism: Tales From the Trump Archive,” from which he showed us a short clip from a 1994 episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with Trump and his wife being interviewed. In the ten-second excerpt, you can witness him objectify his own daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevor sums it up nicely: “Back in 1994, Donald Trump was asked what attributes his one-year-old daughter shared with his wife. He could have said anything! And he went with… legs… and possibly… boobs?!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. That happened. Upon being asked such a simple question about which traits his daughter inherited from her parents, Trump chose to talk about his newborn’s body parts. He said she was beautiful like Marla (his wife at the time). He then said she got Marla’s legs. And then he motioned to his chest and said, “We don’t know whether or not she’s got this part yet, but time will tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevor goes through all the body parts Trump could have pointed to instead (including some obscure ones) — her eyes, her nose, even the weird slab of skin between your thumb and forefinger. Literally anything would have been more appropriate and less sexist.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s no secret that Trump is wildly discriminatory toward women. He constantly uses words like “bimbo” and “fat pig” to describe women he doesn’t like, and he’s made it clear that he finds the very natural and normal bodily function of menstruation to be disgusting. But to objectify your own daughter? Who was still an infant? Beyond disgusting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevor hit that nail on the head when he said, “We know for sure that there’s no female too small for Trump not to reduce her to her body parts…I don’t even think that Trump was trying to be funny or provocative. It just clearly shows that it’s impulse for him. It’s like word association.”\n",

      "#RIPAmericanIdol: Remembering the Show's Top 40 Performances\n",
      "By now, you’ve surely heard the soul-shattering if not entirely surprising news that American Idol has been canceled. Season 15, wrapping this week, will be the long-running (and some might say long-suffering) series’ last.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, Idol haters have been expecting this news for years now — since Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul left the show during Season 9; or when the lovable-but-unmarketable Taylor Hicks won Season 5; or maybe even after Carrie Underwood, who triumphed ELEVEN years ago, became the last winner to rack up multiplatinum album sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I never gave up on this show. And I am so glad I didn’t, because over the past 15 seasons, many contestants, even ones who didn’t exactly set the charts on fire post-Idol, have delivered some truly fantastic performances. And I got to witness — and write about — all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While nearly a decade and a half of Idol has yielded countless cringeworthy karaoke performances that had Simon Cowell making cat-in-a-blender analogies and Randy Jackson using the word “pitchy” more times than he said “in it to win it,” there were many watercooler-chatter-worthy breakout moments that lent the show much-needed credibility. Idol was always supposed to be a talent show, and it indeed leaves behind a legacy of great talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now seems like the right time to look back at the best American Idol performances of all time, as chosen by… me! These are my picks, the performances that stayed with me all these years. If I left out one of your favorites, feel free to mention it in the comments section below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that, in order to keep this list contestant-focused, I didn’t include any all-star duets (sorry, Queen, KISS, Meat Loaf). Also, for the sake of variety and semi-brevity, I did not load up this list with multiple performances by the same singers. But I enthusiastically encourage you to hit up YouTube or Hulu and binge-watch anything and everything by Adam Lambert, Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, Allison Iraheta, Fantasia, et al, and well as this season’s Trent Harmon, La'Porsha Renae, and Dalton Rapattoni. All of those contestants could have filled best-of lists all by themselves.\n",

      "40. Heejun Han – “My Life” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Say what you will about Heejun, but I’ll say he was one of the best things to happen to American Idol’s 11th season. Bringing the comic relief I always knew he was capable of bringing, Heejun finally let it all hang out during an otherwise dull top 10 week — ripping off his button-down suit, sing-shouting the Bosom Buddies-popularized “My Life,” and basically embodying Jon Peter Lewis, Taylor Hicks, Casey Abrams, Magic Cyclops, and Norman Gentle all at once. AMAZING. I still secretly suspect that Heejun was planning to do this all along, and that his time on Idol leading up to this breakthrough had been one long genius act of performance art. Judge Steven Tyler was NOT amused, surprisingly, but I sure was. Why didn’t Fox ever give Heejun his own sitcom?\n",
      "\n",
      "39. Melinda Doolittle - “My Funny Valentine” (Season 6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Melinda is without a doubt one of the greatest divas ever to grace the Idol stage. This exquisite, tasteful performance is a vocal masterclass. Simon Cowell later even said Melinda, who placed third, should have won her season.\n",
      "\n",
      "38. Taylor Hicks - “Trouble” (Season 5)\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot people thought Taylor and his Soul Patrol were just one big joke. Then, in a week when the contestants could pick any (cleared) song of the 2000s, Taylor went with Ray LaMontagne’s “Trouble” – which was not very well-known at that time – declaring it one of his favorite songs. This display of taste and artistry put him in an entirely new light for me. Years later, I will say: Yes, Taylor, you do make me proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "37. Alex Preston, “Always on My Mind” (Season 13)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex, my personal favorite contestant of Idol Season 13, had many great moments that year, but Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind” allowed him to showcase what he always did best: “a sensitive interpretation with a beautiful tone,” as Harry Connick Jr. put it. This gave me some J.Lo-style goosies — especially when Alex broke out that falsetto at the end. He changed up the song just enough to make it his own, while staying respectful to the classic original. Alex is still on my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "36. Constantine Maroulis – “Bohemian Rhapsody” (Season 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Story Continues\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, this was cheesier than a CostCo-sized box of Cheetos, but it was basically Constantine’s sex-eyed audition for Broadway’s Rock of Ages. And he later received a very deserved Tony nomination for that!\n",
      "\n",
      "35. Crystal Bowersox – “I’m Alright” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamasox was usually such a stoic presence on Idol, but on Season 9’s Movie Night, she proved she had a sense of humor… and covered the Caddyshack theme. Simply brilliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "34. Colton Dixon – “Piano Man” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy Joel Night was a mostly dreary affair, but Season 11’s resident piano man closed the show in style, going back to his roots after a few weeks of mostly just using his piano as a prop to jump upon. (He also stayed true to his literal roots, refusing to heed short-term in-house “style expert” Tommy Hilfiger’s lame advice to change his trademark skunky hairstyle.) This performance was simply magnificent. I still haven’t quite gotten over Colton’s shocking seventh-place elimination. I’d always hoped Colton and his awesome hair would make it to the very end.\n",
      "\n",
      "33. Dalton Rapattaoni - “Bird Set Free” (Season 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "After connecting in rehearsal with Sia as they talked about living with bi-polar disorder, during this season’s top four week, this former boy band singer seemed energized and inspired – and he gave a thrillingly unhinged, refreshingly raw performance of Sia “Bird Set Free.” When he belted, “And I don’t care if I sing off-key/I find myself in my melodies/I sing for love, I sing for me,” he really meant it, man. He was totally connected, totally in the moment, giving it his all, and by the end, he was spent and sobbing. And so was everyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "32. Chikezie Eze – “She’s a Woman” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Chikezie only made it to 10th place, and the next time he was in the news, it was because he was busted on felony theft charges. But he had one moment of glory, and it was this amazing, chicken-fried, O Brother-style revamp of a Beatles classic. (A highlight of a mostly disastrous Lennon & McCartney Night featuring Kristy Lee Cook’s scarring-for-life “Eight Days a Week” debacle.) O Chikezie, where art thou now? This performance totally holds up, seven years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "31. Carrie Underwood – “Alone” (Season 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Carrie may be one of the most successful Idols, but she’s low on this list because back in Season 4, the young and green singer exhibited very little charisma. (She herself has admitted to this.) However, this dynamic Heart cover was the first sign that she had the potential to be America’s next superstar.\n",
      "\n",
      "30. Skylar Laine – “Stay With Me” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Skylar came stomping out of the gate right at the start of the season, with a top 25 week performance that was nothing short of a raucous revelation. From the ballsy Faces song choice, to the sassy delivery, to the fun table-turning of Rod Stewart’s original misogynist lyrics… there was a lot to enjoy about Skylar’s vivacious performance. It was just the cowgirl-boot-kick up the bum that this show needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "29. Quentin Alexander – “I Put a Spell On You” (Season 14)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was ready to vote for this superfly guy the instant he strutted out wearing parachute pantaloons, stacks of tribal jewelry, a chubby fun-fur rave coat, and the fiercest, most fearless sex-eyed camera-stare since, well, Constantine’s. And then Quentin did a crazysexycool version of “I Put a Spell on You.” This was theater. This was a performance. And it put a spell on me, for sure. OK, so maybe this wasn’t quite at the level of Annie Lennox’s phenomenal rendition of the Screamin’ Jay Hawkins classic at the Grammys. But it was pretty freakin’ awesome. (And George Clinton agreed! Why wasn’t George ever a mentor on this show?)\n",
      "\n",
      "28. Jennifer Hudson – “Circle of Life” (Season 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow J.Hud ended up in the bottom three (with Fantasia and LaToya London, on one of the most controversial elimination nights ever) a couple weeks after performing this tour de force. But this powerful performance was just a sign of the greatness to come in her career.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. Paul McDonald – “Maggie May” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "More of a Paste magazine coverboy than a typical pop star, Paul brought alt-country (and a really awesome Nudie suit) to the national stage. His risky cover of Ryan Adams’s “Come Pick Me Up” was another Season 11 standout, but his unique rasp suited this Rod Stewart classic perfectly, so this has to be my Paul pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. Joey Cook – “Mad World” (Season 14)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joey did the Donnie Darko version of “Mad World,” and while it wasn’t quite at the same level as Adam Lambert’s rendition from Season 8, it actually came really close. Eschewing her usual goofiness — no accordion, no ukulele, no wacky dancing or Postmodern Jukebox hyperstylization — Joey gave a simple and stripped performance, totally connected to the audience and the song. And she thrilled without even getting up out of her chair. I really enjoyed seeing this once-gimmicky girl blossom into such a fascinating and multi-faceted performer over the course of her season. Joey Cook is the real deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Michael Johns – “It’s All Wrong, But It’s Alright” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would have thought the Aussie alt-rocker would have such a wow moment on Dolly Parton Night? This performance is a bittersweet reminder of what might have been. The talented crooner was shockingly eliminated in eighth place, and he even more shockingly died suddenly in 2014, at age 35.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Elise Testone – “Whole Lotta Love” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m only just now beginning to realize what a great year Season 11 was, seeing that so many performances on this list came from that cycle. It was arguably the last truly great Idol season, and this was another highlight. Elise took a HUGE risk by covering Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” (“the hardest song in the world to sing,” according to Randy Jackson), but she rose to the occasion. “I wasn’t sure if you could pull that off, because nobody can pull that song off,” began Steven Tyler (who apparently didn’t watch Idol Season 8, when Adam Lambert murdered this tune), “but you made Robert Plant proud tonight!” I’ve still got a whole lotta love for this rad rock goddess.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. Brooke White – “Love Is a Battlefield” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "David Cook and Chikezie weren’t the only contestants changing things up in the Season 7, the first Idol season on which contestants were allowed to play instruments. The season featured a slew of creative and adventurous musicians the likes of which the show had never seen, and the Carole King-like Brooke was one of the best. Her reimagining of Pat Benatar’s early-MTV pop-rock anthem as a bittersweet folk ballad was inspired.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. La'Porsha Renae - “No More Drama” (Season 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "This final season was such an emotional one. Along with Dalton’s “Bird Set Free” and guest performer Kelly Clarkson’s tearkerking “Piece by Piece,” La'Porsha had a major moment (in a season filled with great moments) when she sang this Mary J. Blige empowerment anthem. As a domestic abuse survivor, she clearly connected with the song, and she poured all of her pain and sorrow into her triumphant performance. Despite the song’s title, this was incredibly dramatic. And it was magical.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Lilly Scott – “Fixing a Hole” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything went wrong for Season 9 on the night that Lilly (along with Todrick Hall, Katelyn Epperly, and Alex Lambert) went home, right before making the top 12. Watch this delightful ukulele romp (a definite precursor to Season 14’s Joey Cook) and imagine what might have been if Lilly had gone farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Allison Iraheta – “Cry Baby” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "A rocker chick has, sadly, never won American Idol. But this flame-haired badass gave the boys a run for their rock ‘n’ roll money in Season 8 and made it to the top four during the most male-dominated Idol season ever. I was crying like a baby when she was voted off the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. James Durbin – “You Got Another Thing Comin’” (Season 10)\n",
      "\n",
      "The headbanger begged America to “give metal a chance,” and viewers listened, voting James through to the top four. This was the first, and last, time that a Judas Priest song got covered on Idol (aside from the Season 10 finale, when James jammed with Judas themselves). Crank this up to 11 and enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Phillip Phillips – “Volcano” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "P-Squared had had a couple of really rough weeks prior to making the top four, but with this gorgeous cover of a gem by Irish singer-songwriter Damien Rice, he totally redeemed himself. It may have been a risk for him to do such a relatively obscure tune at such a crucial point in the season, and I was bracing myself to hear Jennifer Lopez slam him for being too “artsy” (as she had when Phillip performed the Dave Matthews Band’s “The Stone” during the top six week). But even J.Lo had to admit that this was “one of the most beautiful, poignant moments a contestant has ever had.” Eschewing his usual jam-band shtick and fratty DMB copycattiness, and playing on a hushed, darkened stage with just a cellist and a female backup singer (who was no slouch herself), Phillip generated some real magic here.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Norman Gentle – “And I Am Telling You” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this is another joke contestant, a la Heejun Han. And yes, I did actually rank Norman higher than an Oscar-winner who is famous for what most people would argue is a much better version of this Dreamgirls anthem. So I must be insane, right? Maybe, but I say Norman was the funniest and most fearless Idol contestant ever, and the fact that he actually made it to the live semifinals is pretty remarkable. Norman gave THE best exit performance ever. He will never be forgotten. And he better be invited to the Season 15 finale this year!\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Siobhan Magnus – “Paint It Black” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Siobhan, one of the quirkiest quirky girls that ever quirked on Idol, served up riot grrl realness on Rolling Stones Night, with this dark and stormy performance. Imagine Courtney Love with Ann Wilson pipes, and you’ll get an idea of how fantastic this was.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Trent Harmon - “Chandelier” (Season 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think everyone thought La'Porsha Renae had a lock on the competition this year – until Trent showed up in top four week and did this. It’s not like Trent was ever an underdog to begin with, but this was his script-flipping, Kris Allen-does-“Heartless” sort of moment. It was seismic. And I think the other three must have known they were in danger after they saw him sing. Because this was the look on their faces as they golf-clapped for his performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Jena Irene – “Can’t Help Falling in Love” (Season 13)\n",
      "\n",
      "I adored this performance, and not because it made J.Lo cry (and drop an F-bomb on live television, thus resulting in some very glitchy last-minute editing). Jena’s refreshingly cool and modern, Regina Spektorian interpretation of the 1961 Elvis Presley classic was gorgeous, and — to borrow a more G-rated word from J.Lo’s vocabulary — simply “goosies”-inducing. How did Jena, who placed second that season, not get a major-label record deal of her own? That’s a real reason to curse… or cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Caleb Johnson – “Dazed and Confused” (Season 13)\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh hell yes. Season 13’s Idol top nine show, future champion Caleb made rock history as only the fourth contestant granted permission to cover Led Zeppelin (following Season 8’s Adam Lambert, Season 10’s Haley Reinhart, and Season 11’s Elise Testone — so Caleb was in great company, there). He belted the Zep version of “Dazed and Confused,” and I was left amazed and enthused. This was rad! This felt authentic and awesome… and even “sexy,” as a hot-and-bothered J.Lo attested. Unfortunately, nothing on Caleb’s rushed-then-quickly-forgotten debut album rocked nearly as hard as this, aside from maybe his Justin Hawkins-penned coronation song. But Caleb is still responsible for one of the most headbanging Idol moments ever, and that totally rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Casey Abrams & Haley Reinhart – “Moanin’” (Season 10)\n",
      "\n",
      "Casey and Haley both had their great solo moments on the show, but here they have the honor of being the only duet to make this list. Casey and Haley likely instilled an appreciation for jazz in a whole new generation of young viewers with this sultry, electric performance of this Bobby Timmons 1950s standard. Nowadays, the two continue to make beautiful music together as part of the jazzy collective Postmodern Jukebox.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Jason Castro - “Hallelujah” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Many singing-show contestants have covered this Leonard Cohen classic (it was MacKenzie Bourg’s swan song last week), but Jason’s remains the definitive Idol version; the song really should have been retired from reality television after he did it. His performance was in fact so popular that iTunes downloads of the Cohen, Jeff Buckley, and Rufus Wainwright versions skyrocketed the day after this aired.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Casey James - “Jealous Guy” (Season 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "True “wow moments” were sadly few and far between on Season 9, what was arguably the most disappointing season in Idol history (at least until Season 12 came along). But on Lennon & McCartney Night, eventual third-place contestant Casey’s emotional rendition of John Lennon’s dark and desperate “Jealous Guy” was unexpectedly magical. His voice, possibly due to an authentic lump in his throat, took on a gruff, Eddie Vedder-esque quality during his raw performance, and he seemed genuinely choked up. And so were viewers, by the song’s end.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Bo Bice – “Whipping Post” (Season 4)\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to believe there was ever a time when viewers actually thought runner-up Bo had a chance of winning over future superstar Carrie Underwood, but watch the performance below and it’ll all make sense. Season 4 was the first season when the age limit on Idol was raised (from 25 to 28), and Bo made it clear that the big boys had come to play. His hair-whipping Allman Brothers cover (Willow Smith ain’t got nothin’ on Bo) was all grown-up, with the first hint of actual macho rock ‘n’ roll danger ever seen on this squeaky-clean show. Bo even managed to steal the thunder of his fellow Season 4 rocker Constantine Maroulis with this gritty, Southern rock tour de force.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Candice Glover – “Lovesong” (Season 12)\n",
      "\n",
      "Things were looking pretty dire in Idol’s troubled 12th season, with all of the hype centered on that stupid Mariah Carey/Nicki Minaj feud. But when future champion Candice covered the Cure, all was right with Idol once more. Viewers remembered just how magical this show could really be. Candice’s exquisite performance, which owed more to Adele’s jazzy cover version than to the Cure’s gloomy 1989 original, even had Mariah paying the ultimate compliment: randomly sprinkling Candice with celebratory glitter. “On the behalf of my fellow judges, let me say that was one of the greatest performances in the history of Idol, in all 12 years!” Randy Jackson added. Candice should really be a bigger star today.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Joshua Ledet – “It’s A Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World” (Season 11)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joshua received more standing ovations than any other contestant in the history of American Idol. And deservedly so. Mantasia’s “When a Man Loves a Woman” was almost as brilliant as “Man’s World,” but this was a particularly outrageous performance, full of fire and ferocity and sweat and swagger, and he sang like one of the old-time greats. By the end, J.Lo wasn’t just on her feet, she was almost on her knees, bowing down to him. Steven Tyler was equally worshipful, raving, “No man or woman has ever sang that good with that much passion, ever. I can go home right now. I’ve never heard anything like that in my life!” Randy even called this “one of the best performances in the history of any singing show.” The fact that Joshua didn’t make the finale that year is one of Idol’s great tragedies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Kris Allen – “Heartless” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was perhaps the most game-changing performance in Idol history. Going into Season 8’s top three week, most people would have bet it was Danny Gokey who’d take a place in the following week’s finale alongside Adam Lambert. But after Kris’s acoustic-folk rendition of Kanye West’s “Heartless,” all bets were off. Suddenly, Kris was the man to beat. He made it to the finale over Danny after this, in what was a perfect example of an underdog Idol contestant peaking at just the right time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Kelly Clarkson – “Natural Woman” (Season 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "When Idol first launched, Kelly was far from the frontrunner. It was all about Tamyra Gray and Justin Guarini, and in fact, Kelly’s first audition didn’t even air! But then Kelly came out in her suit and tie and delivered this sultry, star-making performance with THAT NOTE. She’s been Idol’s number-one girl ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. David Cook – “Hello” (Season 7)\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Cook came along, Idol was considered a glorified karaoke competition. Sure, many of the singers delivered fabulous vocals, but they rarely did anything new with their songs. And then there was David. He pretty much changed everything, proving there was a real art to cover songs, an art that went way beyond just singing the words as capably as the original artists had. Idol has been “Cookified” ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fantasia – “Summertime” (Season 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just pure magic. All of America held its breath as Ms. Barrino stunned with this nuanced, sophisticated rendition of this Porgy & Bess classic. Fantasia has been in the news in recent years more for her turbulent personal life, but watch her landmark performance below and get a welcome reminder than she is one of the greatest singers to ever grace the Idol stage. Even guest judge Quentin Tarantino was impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Blake Lewis – “You Give Love a Bad Name” (Season 6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before David Cook, beatboxing boy wonder Blake was the first contestant to do a cover on Idol that really turned a song up on its end and changed it entirely. His Bon Jovi cover is the stuff of legend, and if curmudgeonly Jon Bon Jovi seemed to hate it, that’s probably because he was just jealous that his own version was not nearly as awesome. Blake’s performance was just the shot through the heart, and in the arm, that this show needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Adam Lambert – “Ring of Fire” (Season 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was probably the most polarizing performance on Idol, and definitely the most exciting. Love him or hate him, Adam knew how to get people’s attention, sometimes get people downright angry, and make those who were faint of heart and/or feeble of mind squirm in their support hose — all very good things in the world of rock and pop. On this fateful night, Adam took a strong stance, making it clear that he planned to stay true to himself, even if that meant freaking out Randy Travis with his Goth manicure or refusing to “go country” on Opry Night (though I think black-clad country maverick Johnny Cash would have appreciated this remake). Many Glambert performances — “Mad World,” “Tracks of My Tears,” “Whole Lotta Love” — could’ve made this list, but “Ring of Fire” is the one that really put Adam on the glittery map.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's an unfortunate truth of the internet that no matter what you say, somebody, somewhere will get upset about it. The persistence of that truth seems to increase roughly 1,000 percent when you say something about Harley-Davidson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't matter what you say –– it can be good, it can be bad, it can be indifferent. You could make a seemingly innocuous statement like, \"Harley-Davidson is a company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that is best known for selling motorcycles,\" and someone will lose their mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OMGWTFBBQ! THIS GUY IS SUCH AN IDIOT,\" an anonymous commenter will opine. \"HE'S OBVIOUSLY BEING PAID BY THE COMPETITION. HE'S PROBABLY NEVER RIDDEN. RIDEAPART HAS REALLY GONE DOWNHILL SINCE [insert former writer] LEFT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really like that this is a truth of the internet, but it is. So, when a few people took issue with some of the things I wrote in a recent review of the Harley-Davidson Street Glide Special, I didn't really pay much attention. Haters gonna hate, after all.\n",

      "But then RideApart's creative director, Jim Downs, brought it up with me in an email conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Playing devil's advocate, I have to ask,\" he wrote. \"What's your beef with them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a question that knocked me back a little, because the short answer to his question is: none. I have no beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I first found RideApart many years ago while in the process of searching for articles about the Iron 883, a bike that I loved the look of so much it made me want to return to motorcycling after a few years break.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I eventually rode one, I was considerably less enthusiastic about the bike, but I still get all dreamy eyed every time I see one on the road. I'm like that for most Harley-Davidson motorcycles; I really like the looks of them. As I wrote of the Street Glide Special: \"It looks fantastic. This is a motorcycle upon which any sane human being wants to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In that same review, I also wrote: \"Riding a Harley is like riding a tractor. [And] riding a tractor is awesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which, to me, isn't an attack — unless the definition of \"awesome\" has changed since I left the United States 10 years ago. I did have some criticisms of the bike, but that's part of a review: You look for things that might become issues to the people who eventually shell out thousands of dollars/pounds/euros/darseks for a bike.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, for the sake of answering Jim fully, I decided to sit back and ask myself, honestly: Am I, in some way, biased against Harley-Davidson?\n",

      "READ MORE: 2016 Yamaha FJR1300A & FJR1300ES Sport Touring Models — Ride Review | RideApart\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's impossible to write about motorcycles without some kind of bias. Otherwise every article would just be a list of numbers. The trick to writing honestly, I think, is adjusting your bias to favor the motorcycle-in-question's stated strengths. So, for example, no one ever complains that a BMW S1000RR isn't suitable for off-road trails, or that a Honda Goldwing can't do the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. We don't expect those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the real question is not whether I'm biased, but whether I'm failing to adequately adjust my bias when assessing a Harley-Davidson. Am I expecting things that shouldn't be expected?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I don't know. To me, if you sell a motorcycle for more than US $23,000 and you tell people that it is \"plush, top-end touring technology,\" that's kind of what I expect. My experience was that the bike in question didn't meet those expectations. It was uncomfortable and not up to the given task of touring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even there I didn't feel I was being excessively harsh. I went so far as to point out that my experience might be unique (my 6-foot-1 frame is apparently beyond the target audience of Harley ergonomics) and suggest that if a rider's expectations were different than my own — if he or she planned to use the bike less for touring and more for stylin' and profilin' — it might still be worth the asking price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel my expectations were fair. Or, would have been fair if I had been riding any other bike...\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's not any other bike, is it? A Harley-Davidson is a wholly unique thing, and perhaps to assess it you have to do so in a wholly unique way. Maybe part of the unique way is to be consumed of the same mindset that makes so many of its customers so vociferously loyal. You have to be able to place yourself under the Harley spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I was uncomfortable, because the bike hurt my lower back and gave me a headache, I wasn't really able to do that. I wasn't able to connect on a metaphysical level, and as a result, was left to evaluate the bike as just a material thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, whereas I don't possess a bias against Harley-Davidson products, I equally lack a bias in favor of them. And perhaps, for some people, that is the real problem. Because part of the Harley experience is being wrapped in the Harley mystique, having the faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have a \"beef\" with Harley-Davidson, then, maybe it's that I don't get it; I'm unable to comprehend the emotions that lead other people to get tattoos of this corporation's logo. And maybe –– maybe –– because of that, I'm jealous. I'm annoyed that I don't feel the spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use religious allusions because, in a way, the whole thing reminds me of when I joined a church group in college. I did that primarily because there was an extraordinarily gorgeous girl in the group whose Kentucky drawl and affinity for tight jeans absolutely melted my brain. And ohmygoodness the way she moved! To me, she was clear evidence there must be some kind of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the group's interpretation of that God was something I didn't jive with, its focus too narrow for my tastes. And as a result, I never really connected with any of them. While they were jumping around and shouting, I was thinking: \"This music is kind of basic. This chapel is a little cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unable to get myself to feel whatever they were feeling, I was left to assess it all as just a material experience, which of course meant I was missing the point. And that annoyed me enough that I was eventually able to convince myself it would never work out between myself and the gorgeous girl — even if she hadn't been dating a point guard.\n",

      "On Prince and Identity\n",
      "I cannot recall the minutiae of the day that we met because it doesn't matter. I know that I was in my auntie's living room, the one with the good furniture and new couches, carpet the color and texture of sand underneath us. I cannot be sure of my age, but I know that I was not yet seven, because on the day that I did turn seven, I floated along elated, buoyant with the knowledge that I had lived the same number of years as the title of my favorite song. I have no memory of the weather, just the even, controlled temperature of the apartment and the long sliver of sunlight filtering through the blinds and stretching a rectangle across the floor, a spotlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "My auntie unwraps a package delivered via USPS, slicing through cardboard and paper until her hands produce her prize: a pair of VHS tapes. He gleams at me, gorgeous and lambent under the thin film of plastic. I run my hands over his shiny prettiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" I ask. \"Prince.\" She replies. She rips away the protective covering and pops the tape into the VCR. Prince and his guitar stretch the bounds of the TV's volume, the carpet serving as my transmitter, each fiber soaking up the electronic funk, the melancholy, the black jubilance of Purple Rain, the artist’s semiautobiographical film, delivering it to my cells and self via my soles. By the time we make it to the first cassette of The Hits Vol. 1, the floor is aflame, my body and being along with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Prince came to me that day, his voice fluctuating from coquettish falsetto to sorrowful bass and every variance in between, all my concepts of black maleness and masculinity imploded. I did not need him to be male or female because it was inconsequential; his gender was the same as God's. But I knew that he was black immediately. Who but a black genius could flip his hair, shoulder length and straightened, with eyes glimmering and wide, resplendent with the knowledge of his own audacity?\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Chicagoan, my first concepts of Midwestern identity were based on what we are not: we are neither the East Coast, nor the West. We are amorphous, undefined in a great many ways. I had always understood that the weirdos, the artists and fairies and savants, were products of America's cool coasts; perhaps proximity to sea water is required to fertilize genius. And then there was Prince, a black femme from nowhere adorning his body in purple, deigning himself royalty and not even entertaining contemplations of the contrary. The nerve of him, my god; to be black and boy and born in the Midwest, sprouted from America's heartland, and be a freak. To hold onto his softness, his femaleness, in a world that would have it stamped out. This is not a world that is kind to us, women and womanly folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a ‘90s baby, pop culture was fed to me along with milk and cereal, meaning that I have always been enveloped in misogyny, both implicit and overt, that left me raw and reeling as a girl. I grew resentful of my black girl-ness, my femininity. I quickly came to understand that femininity and feminine people are only valued as things to be consumed, for use and sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite rap songs were the raunchiest, nastiest ones. Songs I was forced to sneak into my grandmother's house, possessing the astuteness to print their lyrics off of my school computer but not the guile to avoid internalizing their fumes, to avoid them seeping into my girl bones and rotting me from the inside out. We lived in the projects, an environment of forced intimacy and communal culture, and songs that I did not discover on my own still reached me via the open windows and doors of my neighbors. Just like the music, ugliness and chaos always found me, like secondhand smoke, via my neighbors and comrades. Boys from my building would gather in the court ways for dogfights that I could never force myself to watch. But I would walk to school in the morning and pass the walkways purpled with blood, with clumps of fur and cartilage spotting the landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until I came to know Prince that I was able to divorce these sounds and images of violence and carnage from my presumed ideas of masculinity. He was my introduction to nontoxic masculinity. He was a male form, but he was not destructive. He was sexual, but he was not predatory. Holy, but not chaste. He did want to do filthy things with you, but he wanted to love you as well, and of course you would love him in return. Of course. Prince was the inauguration of this idea for me, black boys as tenderthings, things I could touch and maybe love without piercing the skin of my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea how I would have come to reconcile my own queerness if Prince had not done it first. I wanted to be both the man and the lover he crooned for. I wanted to possess the hair atop his glorious head and to run my fingers through it as well. I saw that image of Wendy and Lisa, their hands intertwined along the black and white of a keyboard telling us of their dreams, and wanted to add my own, a third set of digits atop theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't feel the need to fully work out whether he was a girl or a boy, because when those first holy notes of \"I Would Die 4 U\" blasted through my aunt's speakers, he assured me that he was neither, but as mighty as both. The pitch of that tambourine, the cadence of his voice, cool, level, and our champion, black and bathed in purple light and lace. What was he if not a black femme in church, delivering the sermon and receiving it as well, his body writhing and contorting as he was filled with a holy spirit which very well may have been his own?\n",
      "\n",
      "I watched him, felt him, heard him, drank him in and knew that this celestial being, a supernova housed in a black boy vessel, had no use for mortal constraints as silly and diminutive as \"female\" or \"male.\" Why would Prince, our messiah, our purple nebula, our transcendent femme king, adhere to such trivial, colonialist tripe as the gender binary or stereotypical masculinity when he was not even a child of this galaxy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The boxes that we are ascribed, as black folks, queer folks, femmes, and artists require that we lop off parts of ourselves to fit into them; there is no room for our brilliance, for our full, ridiculous selves. Prince would perform no such surgery. He was our science non-fiction, magic realism come alive and rattling my auntie's walls in Washington Park, permitting me to be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words belong to the definers, not the defined. And here he was, refusing any putative definition of man or woman at all, and eventually, saying he would own the fruits grown from his black voice and body and hands. He had always dwelled beyond the spectrum of gender, but then he remade himself, shed a layer or four, wicked the dew from his gorgeous wings and decided that there were no words worthy of him; we could have him only as a symbol which exists beyond what our mortal, lazy tongues could shape. He wasn’t even human; his voice slithered from his throat in computerized lulls on \"Computer Blue,\" moments after Wendy and Lisa had an exchange I was too young to understand, but I knew that when Lisa asked, \"Shall we begin?\" a million nerve endings, from my eyes to my ankles, screamed \"yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always hated sports. Not only because I find them dull, but because the tensions and anxieties of sports fandom make me nauseous, force my stomach to lilt and shift as wildly as prince on the floor during \"Darling Nikki.\" As a girl, everyone around me loved Michael Jordan, the black boy who could fly, but I knew his secret. Michael was just a man, made of water and salt and bone like the rest of us. One wrong twist of his ankle on his way back to earth, a fall or push from his measly components could be enough to smash his knees to dust and render him flightless, earth stranded. Prince was a magic I could believe in. He was omniscient, conceptual, in the way that queerness always has been, he existed beyond the realm of human, corporal frailties. He wasn’t a man, he was an assemblage of purple energy bound within a lovely frame, that which could never be lost or destroyed. But even the sun will eventually burn out, leave us alone to the cold dark. I am stumbling around in the dark now, searching for trails of soft purple beams of light to guide me.\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a proud product of public school, and I am determined to usher my children through public school, as well, in spite — or perhaps because — of the fact my oldest has intellectual and developmental delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we learned about our son's Down syndrome (Ds) diagnosis prenatally, we worried about everything from his heart (kids with Down syndrome often have varying levels of heart troubles) to his ability to make friends. The more we learned, the more we also mulled over how to give him the best education possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Popular\n",
      "\n",
      "Living paycheck to paycheck made that decision somewhat easier, because we knew private school wasn't an option. We tossed our hat into the charter school ring and wound up at the end of a 500-strong waiting list. But neither choice felt 100% right. I thought, who isn't holding our school district to a high enough standard for our children with different abilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "What really gelled my dedication to sticking with public school was watching the slow trickle of families of children with special needs in our school district move to surrounding counties for \"better services.\" Well, sometimes the grass only looks greener, and soon most voiced renewed and similar struggles. Besides, we love where we live, and we love our community. We didn't want to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were the anecdotes. \"Oh, I've never seen [our school district] put a child with Down syndrome in general curriculum,\" a pediatrician told us. \"[Your school district] is known for putting its head in the sand when it comes to kids with disabilities,\" a therapist told us. \"It's all about money. Kids with disabilities are expensive. I think they just hope we all go somewhere else,\" a mom shared with me. Every hair on this mama bear's head spiked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Courtesy of Maureen Rich Wallace\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is, the community of children with Down syndrome is small. It's easy to see how a school district can justify putting our children's needs below a larger community — for example, autistic children. But we all know being in the minority should never diminish our value or seat at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't we?\n",
      "\n",
      "I've researched Down syndrome for almost six years now, and while I can never claim to be an expert, I've never found study results that show children with Down syndrome thrive in self-contained classes — i.e., smaller classes of only other children with disabilities. When I wrote about the benefits of inclusion (which means including a child with a disability in a classroom of neurotypical children), I connected with some of our country's top advocates for children with Down syndrome: men and women who had changed law, education policy and mindsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they could do that for a swath of the country, couldn't I do that for my own child's small community?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, here we are. Charlie is included about 79% of the time in a general education kindergarten class — and in our home school, which brings the advantage of developing friendships with children who live in our community. He uses a combination of word approximations, signs and an impressive variety of facial expressions to convey his wants and needs. He calls his classmates his \"fens\": friends. \"Bye, fens!\" he shouts as we drive past kids still waiting to be picked up at the end of the day. Every returned wave, smile or chorus of, \"Byyyye, Charlieeeeeee!\" tells me we're doing the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frustration is that we feel like the school district isn't setting him up to succeed. He has bitten, kicked and scratched his teacher — this isn't behavior we see at home. All behavior is communication, and he's tired and stressed. His little body has to work harder than the other kids to make it through the day, and this is the first year where he doesn't have a built-in nap time. He is exhausted by the end of the day, and his behavior declines as the day goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Courtesy of Maureen Rich Wallace\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is helping his school team understand how effective inclusion can work. It's not about \"dumbing down\" a lesson plan. It's about meeting each child's needs for that curriculum. While one group of kids is learning to write nouns and verbs together, Charlie can work on matching nouns and verbs. It takes time, patience and creativity, but effective inclusion has proven to be the best scenario for both children with disabilities and their typically developing peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has it been easy? I'm sure that answer is relative. My husband and I have taken turns tearing up during conferences and Individualized Education Meetings, calming each other at home and reaching out to various resources for more perspective. We are encouraged by Charlie's team this year, all young educators who perhaps have a touch of uninformed optimism (like us) but who (like us) are determined to make this work. Passion for a child can drive so much, but dedication to doing the right thing must originate with leadership when it comes to successful inclusion in education. Everyone deserves to be treated equally, and Charlie deserves to learn alongside his peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doing it right\" means ensuring a child like ours receives support, services and a team who believes in him. We need every cog in the education wheel to be all in: the superintendent; her staff; our principal; each educator and even a cafeteria worker who either understands the value of letting Charlie choose his own food or does it for him because it's faster. It's easier to just push him through the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Successful inclusion is hard. So is parenthood. Shouldn't we all be held to the same standard of dedication to getting it right?\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not giving up.\n",

Besides, my doctor and I enjoy talking about these matters. He says it helps with my treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked a variety of people, but mostly rock writers wrote back. (As if making a list requires anyone to write!) I didn’t solicit comments, since I didn’t want this blog to read like the “Deluxe and Expanded Re-Mastered Version of War and Peace.” For my own list, I grabbed some names that didn’t make the others. I wrote up the 20 entries that caught my eye. But don’t take that to mean that the other suggestions are any less deserving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participating in this poll does not imply that you care about what happens with the Hall of Fame. This is for amusement purposes only. Thanks to all who participated. Obviously, I think quite a bit of your opinion.\n",

      "Readers, don’t forget to write in your own faves.\n",
      "\n",
      "20) Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes: I’ve had to check the list several times to make sure the Blue Notes were not admitted. That’s how hard it is to believe. Listen, I know Philly is one of those cities that always gets dumped on, but you can’t argue with Philly Soul. Besides, the Hall itself is located in Cleveland, so it’s not like it doesn’t understand the plight of the underdog.\n",
      "\n",
      "19) Captain Beefheart: Average people like to claim that Rock Critics are an elitist, snotty bunch with too much control. But clearly that is not true because the great Captain has gotten great reviews and sold very few records and is nowhere near the Hall of Fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "18) The Cure: It’s really annoying how many great British bands have been left out of the Hall. Sure, most of the 1960s bands all got in, but after that, no Brits need apply. The Cure were so incredibly versatile. I also vote for Bauhaus and the Sisters of Mercy. Just think — a Goth wing! No windows and you could save a bundle on lighting!\n",
      "\n",
      "17) Kraftwerk: Electronic music has been such an important part of rock music in the ensuing decades. Can’t these guys get in under the “influences” tag if nothing else? In fact, where are any of the great German bands?\n",
      "\n",
      "16) Journey: OK, OK, I’ve been less than kind to them in the past. But I’m not everyone. And Yahoo Music’s own Lyndsey Parker certainly knows what the men don’t understand. I’m more partial to letting in her beloved faves Duran Duran, since they were an important part of early MTV. But just as your favorite musical acts made an indelible impression on you when you were a small person, so did Journey on young Lyndsey. Miss L remains a hardcore music junkie. That’s more than you can say for most people. She cares!\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Moby Grape: Moby Grape were the best band to come out of that 1960s San Francisco scene and they’re the ones who aren’t here! They paid the first time around and they’re paying now!\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Big Star: How the Hall can continue to ignore the “marginal” figures who have kept the flame alive for so many is just another chapter in a book I never intend to write! (Too busy listening to music.)\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Buzzcocks: I guess the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash, and Stooges are all we need to know of punk. It might have helped if these guys were signed to Sire.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Brian Eno: Brian is known to many people, except, I suppose, to those people voting in the real Hall. But really? Roxy Music isn’t in? And neither is Eno? Can’t U2 or Talking Heads do anything about this?\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Love: Whenever you realize Arthur Lee and Love are not in the Hall, just remind yourself that U2 and the Eagles made it.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) The Monkees: I know, this is where the Hall applies their standards. Again, I invoke what will be known hereafter as the “U2 Defense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "9) The Dead Boys: There were so many great punk bands that have no likely shot at the Hall. Rocket From the Tombs, Pere Ubu, Richard Hell & The Voidoids, X Ray Spex, X, Suicide, the Dictators… take your kids to the zoo instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Graham Parker: Had Graham Parker studied harder, he could’ve been Elvis Costello. Instead, he’s a few steps ahead of Garland Jeffreys.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) The Modern Lovers: Jerry Harrison got in as a member of Talking Heads and maybe someday David Robinson will get in as a member of the Cars. But the Modern Lovers, with auteur Jonathan Richman, were so much more, y’know!\n",

      "Inspired to speak out amidst the recent surge in anti-LGBT legislation around the country, Target wanted to make sure we all understand their views on how people should be treated, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity. In a blog post from Tuesday (I KNOW, TARGET HAS A BLOG, IT'S MY DREAM TOO), Target emphasized their support of the federal Equality Act and clarified that everyone should be able to use the restroom that best fits their gender identity when shopping for bargain housewares, groceries, and bathing suits.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recent debate around proposed laws in several states has reignited a national conversation around inclusivity. So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It's something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a time when LGBT rights are being questioned and threatened at such a visceral pace, seeing a national chain like Target make such an open declaration of equality on an issue as heated as restroom politics is great. But of course, because haters can't help themselves, people have started voicing serious dissatisfaction about Target's inclusive restroom policy. Some are posting comments directly to Target's Facebook page, and others are rallying behind the hashtag #BoycottTarget. There's also an actual pledge for this, which, like ... why? Don't you guys have jobs? I'm so confused! But please don't bother explaining the logic behind this to me, because I really do not care, bye!\n",

      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. I wonder if any of these alleged boycotters are aware that Target has long had a reputation for being LGBT-friendly. Last August, the store announced an initiative to move away from \"gender-based signs\" that suggest who products like bedding and toys are for. And then a month later, in September 2015, Target announced official support of the federal Equality Act. So it's unclear if the restroom thing was just too far for these folks, or if they just mistakenly believed — all this time — that Target was on whatever political team it is that they belong to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, guys! Feel free to boycott if that's what you want. Shorter lines for the rest of us, who are aware of all the very reputable data that shows allowing people to use the restroom that makes them feel the most comfortable isn't actually harmful to anybody.\n",

Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” she said during the town hall. “And we’re going to make it clear that we don’t want to forget those people.

And the flat, matte texture made it feel like there was nothing on my lips, so I could definitely see myself wearing it all day without needing to reapply.

Looking back at what Daly has accomplished—two major wins and an Everyman, grip-it-and-rip-it appeal that has brought untold new fans to the game—does JD deserve consideration for a bust in the World Golf Hall of Fame?\n",

      "Michael Bamberger, senior writer, Sports Illustrated: For sure. Fred getting in really lowered the bar. Angel Cabrera is getting in, too. Zach Johnson, yes. (Dustin Johnson, show us something, would you?) Davis: no brainer. I'd wait on Daly. The senior career can have more weight if we use to measure a player's achievements. The three senior majors are serious business.\n",

      "Joe Passov, senior editor, Golf Magazine (@joepassov): If the World Golf Hall of Fame creates a Novelty Wing, sort of a sideshow attraction, John Daly is a slam dunk. Otherwise, forget it. I loved watching JD gripping it and ripping it, both in his heyday and beyond. However, the same issues that kept him from making a single Ryder Cup team, despite two majors, will keep him out of the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff Ritter, digital development editor, Sports Illustrated Golf Group (@Jeff_Ritter): I think he's close. Two major titles are obviously big. My hall of fame test is, \"Is this golfer's career important to the story of the game of golf?\" Daly's win at the '91 PGA at Crooked Stick was seismic, and he backed it up at a St. Andrews Open. Of course he's also a colorful character and hugely popular, and I believe that matters at least a little to the HOF (call it the \"Freddie Effect\"). I think with a senior career that's even modestly successful, he's in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Josh Sens, contributing writer, GOLF Magazine (@JoshSens): Strictly speaking, his record qualifies him, but induction at this point doesn't feel quite right. That said, I like the idea of the Novelty Wing (weird swings, crazy nicknames, madcap antics). If they ever do build it, that’s where I'd spend the afternoon.\n",

Yes, it gives us all something to talk about, but those picks have had zero positive effect on U.S. outcomes over the past decade. We'd be better off picking out of a hat.\n",

After watching the video, I wasn't appalled with anything, even as I'll defend any club's rights to enforce its rules. Sure, it was boys acting like boys, but they didn’t do anything that isn't done at any other club I know of.

My problem comes with defining the terms. \"Toughest to win,\" may have one conclusion by Mr. Brodie's measures, but we don’t have to buy it. I'll argue the Players has the best field, which would fit one definition of \"toughest,\" but my pick is the U.S. Open. Even with all of those qualifiers and regional amateurs and such, a typical U.S. Open serves up the most demanding test. Combine that with the implications from winning--you would be the U.S. Open champion--makes it the \"toughest\" for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "Van Sickle: I could not disagree more with Mr. Broadie. Due to the usual summer heat, the PGA's greens are usually watered to keep them alive. Thus the greens are receptive. You saw Jason Day get to 20 under par last summer at Whistling Straits, a record score, and he needed it to beat Jordan Spieth. I don't know how you define toughest to win but since the PGA often has the easiest scoring conditions, it's definitely not the toughest. The U.S. Open is more difficult, the Masters has more pressure and risky holes and the British Open carries the weight of history. I don't get it.\n",

I just knew that Scott was enjoying a superb season, much to my surprise. I figured without his anchored putter, he was as good as done. Instead, he's resembled the guy we saw in 2013. We just won't see him in the Olympics.\n",

      "Donald Trump is Wrong — Harriet Tubman Belongs on the $20 Bill\n",
      "The US Treasury’s move this week to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the front of the $20 bill is significant for a number of reasons, although some, including Donald Trump , have disagreed. First, a woman is replacing a man. Second, a black person is replacing a white person. Third, an abolitionist and anti-slavery activist is replacing a former slaveholder. But there is a fourth and ultimately even more important rationale.\n",
      "\n",
      "With change afoot in the US currency, it is not difficult to see why Jackson would inspire little loyalty. Though he was a war hero who served as the nation’s seventh president and fought successfully to kill the national bank, he also owned hundreds of slaves, supported the forced relocation of Indian tribes, and helped to install the spoils system in US politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman presents a remarkable contrast that makes her seem, at first glance, an unlikely replacement. She was born into slavery and lived in poverty for much of her life. She never learned to read or write. She never commanded an army or won election to any public office. She even suffered from seizures, perhaps as a result of a head injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, in an age when Americans seem particularly enamored of the rich, powerful, and glamorous, Tubman represents an extraordinary anachronism. She was no Donald Trump billionaire, who said on the Today Show on Thursday that he thinks Tubman is “fantastic” — but added the move to have her replace Jackson is “pure political correctness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman also did not aspire to the high political offices of Hillary Clinton , who on Wednesday tweeted: “A woman, a leader, and a freedom fighter. I can't think of a better choice for the $20 bill than Harriet Tubman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And no one tried to keep up with Tubman in the manner of the Kardashians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in other ways, she was a remarkable human being. An escaped slave, she fought to free other slaves and became one of the nation’s leading abolitionists. At great personal risk, she served as a key figure in the Underground Railroad, helping to lead many to freedom. Testifying to her importance as an opponent of slavery, a fellow abolitionist once dubbed her “Moses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She also became one of the leading figures in the nation’s women’s suffrage movement. She pointed to countless acts of selfless courage by women during the Civil War and throughout history as evidence that women could prove just as noble as men. She believed that race and gender revealed nothing about a human being’s worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such contributions shine even more brightly when we recall the many disadvantages and setbacks in life she had to overcome to play her leadership role in US history. In recounting her feelings as she moved from slavery to freedom, she offered one of the most inspiring accounts of the impulse to serve ever uttered by an American:\n",
      "\n",
      "I had crossed the line of which I had so long been dreaming. I was free; but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a stranger in a strange land, and my home after all was down in the old cabin quarter, with the old folks, and my brothers and sisters. But to this solemn resolution I came; I was free, and they should be free also; I would make a home for them in the North, and the Lord helping me, I would bring them all there.\n",
      "\n",
      "After serving as a Union Spy, becoming the first woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War, and working tirelessly to liberate and support former slaves, Tubman was headed home to New York when she was told by a train conductor to move to another car. When she refused, the conductor and other passengers forcibly removed her, breaking her arm in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we come to the fourth reason Tubman is a great choice: too many government representatives grace US currencies. Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and Grant were all US presidents. Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin, though not, each played huge roles as government leaders – Hamilton as first secretary of the treasury, and Franklin as a diplomat and elder statesman.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a natural tendency for the US government to memorialize its own, but many people who never served in any official capacity have played equally important roles in shaping American culture and charting the history of the United States. Consider, for example, Thomas Paine, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Thomas Edison, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n",
      "\n",
      "The likes of Tubman remind us that wealth, power, and fame are not essential ingredients in the recipe for a life of significance, the kind that enriches and inspires the lives of others. Many Americans will never be chronicled in the pages of Fortune, but each of us can aspire to lead a life that leaves the world a better place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most compelling reason Harriet Tubman belongs on US currency is this: She reminds us that an ordinary person – someone with little money, who holds no lofty political office, commands no army, and lacks natural gifts such as musical talent, and athletic ability – can, through moral imagination and courage, make a difference in the lives of others, even changing the course of history.\n",

      "Joanie Laurer, best known to legions of professional wrestling fans as former WWE diva Chyna, was found dead today in her Los Angeles home. No cause of death has been released for Laurer, who was 45. “It is with deep sadness to inform you today that we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th wonder of the world has passed away,” read a message posted to her Facebook page Wednesday evening. “She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Born December 27, 1970 in Rochester, New York, Laurer became famous in 1997 after joining the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), adopting the name Chyna and billed as “The 9th Wonder Of The World” in tribute to WWE legend Andre the Giant. Wrestling against both women and men, her sexual identity, large stature and tomboy persona presented as the antithesis of the usual diva persona, and she enjoyed spectacular success in pro wrestling for the next four years. She was forced out of WWF in 2001 following a personal conflict with WWE wrestler and executive Stephanie McMahon, returning only sporadically to wrestling after.Famously, she was forced to stop using the name Chyna for a period due to the trademark being owned by WWF – she later filed paperwork to change her name legally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following her wrestling career, she appeared in a small number of pornographic films (she had also modeled for Playboy in 2000, and did so again in 2002), and pursued acting, appearing on episodes of 3rd Rock From The Sun, among other roles. She also found success on reality tv, appearing on Fear Factor, and in various incarnations of The Surreal Life.\n",

      "No one has proven yet that numbers of followers translates to revenue. So it is frustrating. I know a lot of people -- legitimate fashion people -- can’t stand it. Hate it that these, you know, social media stars are now the supermodels in fashion. They are not true supermodels. And the thing is, I have always looked to Vogue magazine to lead the way, not be a follower. I rely on Vogue to set the standard, not follow what everybody else is doing. So I have been disappointed that fashion magazines have been supporting this trend of social media stars to set our style standards. But it will change; fashion always does.\n",

My primary concern at 14 was whether my friends would be in the same class as me at a new school, not holding down my boyfriend for a decade. I was very prepared for it to fizzle out around the 3-6 month mark like most teenage romances. However, month after month, and year after year, I was pleasantly surprised. We just kept making each other happy, so we stayed together.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we are actually happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could accuse me of protesting too much, but that’s the thing — people often think that we are somehow secretly unhappy, like we’re just staying together because we’re used to it by now. We aren’t. Jokes about ball-and-chain and “the wife, right?!” elicit nothing but eye rolls from the pair of us. We laugh every day, we hang out, we actually really quite like one another as people. It isn’t difficult to keep sticking around when we want to keep hanging out with one another. We have an easy, sweet time together and do fun stuff like travel, see bands we like, and explore new bars in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes — we are allowed to do things alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went for dinner with a new colleague recently, and she asked me, “Won’t he mind?” We are not connected at the hip, and we are allowed to do things alone. We have different interests, and different friends. He has no time for reading or running or poetry. I have none for animation or watching Tim and Eric. While we do have things we want to do together, we haven’t become one singular person with one thought process. While we often hang out with mutual friends, there are just times when I want to go and do things alone. I go on holidays separately from him, to concerts, shopping, and more. And that’s perfectly fine — and healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still find other people attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, really. Your ability to see and understand that someone outside of your relationship is cute doesn’t disappear when you hit a certain point, it’s just whether you’re strong enough to not act on it. Despite this, if I ever mention that someone isn’t totally hideous or that I have a crush on some actor or other, inevitably, someone will remind me that I have a boyfriend. I do, yeah. And we talk about our little crushes together, and then don’t act on them. The healthy, monogamous, not-dead way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just because we have only been with one person, doesn’t mean we haven’t had experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "When people tell me I’ve missed out on life experience or all of the potential dudes out there, I just know I don’t want that, really. There has been no time when I’ve been unhappy enough in my relationship to leave my boyfriend for some experiences I might or might not like. Besides, I have had plenty of experience. I have friends, I’ve travelled, I have a career, I moved really far away from home. I have everything I want and I’m in love with my best friend, so I’m doing just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are in no rush to have kids or get married.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may have been together for nine years, but we are still 23. We are babies — babies who work in creative industries. While it’s a nice thought, marriage is an incredibly, unnecessarily expensive step that I really don’t need to reassure me that my boyfriend loves me. I’d rather spend my money instead on holidays and saving for a home before worrying about one really fancy day. Kids, though, are another story entirely… a terrifying one for two people who very recently had to call a locksmith because they got drunk and left both sets of house keys inside. Those people are not ready to look after another human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven’t stopped having sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, please. We love each other. We live together. Figure that one out and stop asking me intrusive, intimately personal questions as soon as you meet me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it’s taken a lot of work to get here, but for the most part, our situation is pretty easygoing, because we just like one another. When I get told I’ve wasted half my life, I just imagine all of the things we have done together that I would have missed had I been single or dating for all of those years. We are happy, and I see no need to jeopardize that in search of some experiences I might or might not enjoy.\n",

      "The Honeymoon Is Over for Oculus Rift\n",
      "Well, that didn't take long.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of people excited about the Oculus Rift, but the hardware maker is already facing a growing backlash from customers who pre-ordered the device and, at this point, have no idea when they'll get their hands on one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse still, they complain, inquiries to the company are largely being ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was so excited for this week, and Oculus just took a big [expletive deleted] on that,\" wrote one frustrated user on Reddit . \"I thought this week would be filled with a million unboxing videos and everyone talking about their awesome experiences. Instead we get this. The store opens when almost no one has a Rift, developers must be wondering why no one is buying their games, and now everyone is just angry or frustrated. All I want is communication from Oculus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oculus did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day before the Rift's official launch, co-founder and CEO Palmer Luckey promised at the time units would start arriving for Kickstarter backers on Monday followed by customers who pre-ordered later would receive units by mid-week, likely Wednesday. That was quickly followed by a tweet asking buyers to \"stay tuned for future updates\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay tuned for future updates, I will give them as soon as possible - this particular update was set in stone just hours ago! - Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) March 28, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "On Twitter, there have been no updates from Luckey, other than a repost of the above Tweet on Thursday. But Luckey has dropped by the Oculus subreddit occasionally throughout the week to address some of the complaints of the Rift's hard core fan base about the company's general radio silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't shunt blame to other people, this is my call,\" Luckey wrote . \"I am not going to wax poetic about this, since I have done so in the past, but bottom-line: I won't give in-depth updates on any situation without knowing it is solid, true, and finalized. Until I can do so, the best I can do is remind people that I will get them information as quickly as I can. On the rare occasions when things still change, even when they change for reasons out of my control, I get crucified anyway. Sometimes that means updates have to wait until things get locked down, and sometimes that means waiting a little longer to give everyone good info.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While no one knows exactly what's causing the delays in shipping Rift units, there are some common themes in the complaints. Many buyers whose pre-orders entailed a March delivery insist they have not only not received their Rifts, but they haven't yet seen the charges show up on their credit cards or received an email saying the order is processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "That could be a problem with the payment provider or a last minute manufacturing issue. Oculus owner Facebook ( fb ) has never made a mass-market physical product before, which is possibly why units are in such short supply at launch—or it could be something else entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vocal minority (and it does appear to be a vocal minority at this point), at least, doesn't seem to care and is getting fed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community unrest isn't the only of Oculus' problems. Critics were decidedly mixed on the Rift in early reviews. Tech publications gave it a fairly enthusiastic welcome. But mass market media outlets, like the Wall Street Journal , bluntly assessed that the Rift \"isn't ready for the mainstream.\"\n",

      "\"He completely ignored my request, made my sandwich, added cheese (which he didn't even ask if I wanted), and threw it in the toaster,\" Small explained. \"He said that there are 20 people in line and he has already made 90 sandwiches today. He then said 'THIS IS FAST FOOD, NOT FINE DINING!' He also attempted to prove that the meat was hot enough by pulling out a thermometer. He was completely out of line, rude, and belittling my request that was in the best interest for my unborn baby.\"\n",

      "Small and another woman who had watched the whole thing go down ended up leaving the restaurant without food. \"I was in tears and that's embarrassing in public,\" Small told FOX6Now. \"It's easy for a pregnant woman to cry but I was also upset because of what just happened.\"\n",

      "A judge in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, ruled Monday night that the state’s strict new voting law is constitutional, delivering a major win for conservatives who have sought to tighten laws across the country, and dealing a blow to efforts to stop those laws. Judge Thomas Schroeder’s opinion—included in a massive, 485-page ruling—upheld the full swath of HB 589. Passed by the Republican-dominated General Assembly in 2013, the law changed a slew of North Carolina’s voting rules, including reducing early voting, eliminating same-day registration, banning out-of-precinct voting, and ending pre-registration for 16-year-olds. Perhaps most prominently, the bill instituted a requirement that voters show photo ID to cast a ballot. Related Story The Past Goes On Trial in North Carolina Legislators and other proponents of the bill argued that the voter-ID law was a commonsense measure, and that it and other changes were needed to prevent fraudulent voting. The law’s opponents, meanwhile, pointed that there were practically no documented cases of voter fraud in the state, and argued that the changes would disproportionately affect poor and minority voters in the Old North State—voters who are more likely to vote Democratic, which they argued was not a coincidence. Much of the trial focused on whether there was real evidence of fraud, and whether the law actually disadvantages minorities. Both sides brought a barrage of experts to back their view. Schroeder, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled that while North Carolina had been on the progressive end of the spectrum of voting, the new rules were simply retrenchment and were constitutional. He said the plaintiff—a group that included the North Carolina NAACP, the Justice Department, and others—“failed to show that such disparities will have materially adverse effects on the ability of minority voters to cast a ballot and effectively exercise the electoral franchise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Schroeder’s decision to uphold the law was not unexpected. The plaintiffs have already vowed to appeal the decision to a federal appeals court. The trial was held in two phases. The first, which began last July, focused on the early voting, out-of-precinct voting, and same-day registration portions. Because of last-minute changes to the voter-ID section of the law—legislators created a process by which voters could cast a ballot by swearing they had a “reasonable impediment” to getting a photo ID—a trial about the ID requirement was not held until January. Schroeder upheld both halves of the law in his ruling. The voting law was passed shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act that required certain states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to receive “pre-clearance” from the Justice Department before changing their voting laws. While Republicans had been considering changes already, the ruling allowed them to expand their ambition. “Now we can go with the full bill,” Senator Tom Apodaca, chairman of the rules committee, said at the time. With the Voting Rights Act in the background, the fight over HB 589 became a referendum on the past, and whether the new rules were—as the plaintiffs charged—a revival of Jim Crow rules like literacy tests, intended to weed out black voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is our Selma,” said the Reverend William Barber II, the head of the state NAACP and an organizer of “Moral Mondays,” a series of huge demonstrations in Raleigh and elsewhere that have gone on since Republicans took control of the state and began passing a series of very conservative reforms. The defendants disagreed. “The history of North Carolina is not on trial here,” a lawyer for Governor Pat McCrory said at the trial. In the end, Schroeder sided with the defendants. “There is significant, shameful past discrimination. In North Carolina's recent history, however, certainly for the last quarter century, there is little official discrimination to consider,” he wrote. “There is significant, shameful past discrimination. In North Carolina's recent history, however, there is little official discrimination to consider.” Once the central story in the Old North State’s political battle—the state has become hyperpolarized in the years since Republicans won control of the General Assembly in 2010 and the governorship in 2012—the voting-rights story has been pushed to the side more recently by the even-hotter controversy over HB2, the recently enacted law that bans transgender bathroom accommodation in state facilities and preempts city rules on transgender accommodations, LGBT non-discrimination, and living wages. In the hours before Schroeder’s ruling was revealed on Monday, Moral Monday protestors were demonstrating in the streets of Raleigh against HB2. During the voting-rights trial, the defendants presented evidence that the tools that had been eliminated were disproportionately used by black voters. But the defendants countered by showing that black turnout in 2014, when all but the voter-ID portion was in effect, actually increased over the previous midterm elections, a jump the plaintiffs attributed to a contested Senate election and grassroots organizing after the law. The defendants also argued that the law couldn’t be unconstitutional because several other states offer similarly few accommodations.\n",

      "Is Planet Nine behind mass extinctions on Earth? One astrophysicist says yes\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "Planet Nine has seen its share of headlines lately, but its newfound popularity is also bringing back theories that the yet-to-be-discovered planet may have affected, and may in the future affect, life here on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retired astrophysicist and current University of Arkansas math professor Dr. Daniel Whitmire says Planet Nine’s suspected multi-million year orbit around the sun may trigger comet bombardments. His analysis suggests this happens about once every 27 million years.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does this happen? Planet Nine passes through the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond the outermost planets that is the breeding ground for comets and asteroids alike. As the planet passes through this region, it disrupts the paths being followed by comets, sending some of them hurtling toward the inner solar system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmire’s research found that some of these comets not only would end up striking Earth, but that they would also disintegrate in large numbers, effectively lowering the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth. Furthermore, Whitmire was able to match the theorized interval of Planet Nine’s orbit through the Kuiper Belt to mass extinction events here on Earth, lending credence to paleontologist theories that the death of the dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures may indeed have been the result of comet impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is not a perfect one-to-one correlation,” Whitmire told Digital Trends in an interview Friday. He attributed the events that did not correlate to statistical randomness. “Nonetheless the statistical analysis shows a strong regular period of 27 million years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whitmire already showed back in 1985 — when he first started looking into the possibility of Planet Nine-related comet barrages — that the pattern held for at least the last 250 million years. Newer research suggests that these barrages may actually have been happening for as much as 500 million years, and quite possibly longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest comet shower is thought to have occurred around 11 or so million years ago, around the time of the Middle Miocene mass extinction. Before that, similar events were thought to have occurred around 38 and 66 million years ago, the latter thought to be the comets that killed off the dinosaurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t ring the alarm bells though for the next bombardment. Humankind will likely be dramatically evolved (if hopefully not long gone) by the time Planet Nine passes through the Kuiper Belt again. “Modern man doesn’t have worry about the next comet shower for 16 million years,” Whitman quipped.\n",

      "IT HAPPENED TO ME: I Went to Prison for Selling My Friend the Drugs That Killed Her\n",
      "I was 18 years old when I started dating a guy who introduced me to the world of drugs. I had tried alcohol and smoked marijuana a few times — nothing that really got me interested. He gave me hydrocodone. It all started there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple years later, I was dating another guy — one that had connections my little opiate-adoring self could only imagine having. That's when I was introduced to heroin. It became like a best friend to me — we were together every day. I would get it with any form of payment possible: money or sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend eventually went to rehab, and I said I would get sober. I didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through mutual friends, I met a girl on the night of my 21st birthday. Sasha* was dating my friend's ex-boyfriend, so that meant I automatically hated her. Then I got to know her, and then we started hanging out, and then we started doing heroin together — all in the course of one day. What's the fastest track to becoming best friends? Doing drugs together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first started using, I was snorting powder. I got to the point that my tolerance began to increase. I was curious and had Sasha shoot me up. It was then that I decided that was the better way of getting my high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our routine for when we would hang out entailed the following: we would go to the grocery store and steal candy and one-liter bottle of soda; we would then drive back to where Sasha was staying, which switched several times within that year; she would then make up a shot for each of us. I would get mine first, hers next. I would make Sasha shoot me up first because one time she went first and was nodding off when she was trying to give me my shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fun only lasted so long. I was getting to the point where I felt it wasn't worth it. I was either begging my grandpa and parents for money, stealing the money from my family, or fucking the drug dealer. I'd had enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my mom I wanted to get sober, and I went to a methadone clinic. I was evaluated and started my dosing, going every morning until I graduated to taking home doses. Things were going fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, I had been working at a doctor's office. My boss told me one day to sort samples — the expired and the non-expired. I had to remove the expired samples from their packaging and dispose of them in a box; someone had already started, and I saw some stuff still packaged in the disposal box.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's when I came across some fentanyl patches. It was like an opiate addict's version of winning the lottery. I grabbed nine patches and stuffed them in my purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on, I texted Sasha with the good news. She was immediately interested in what I had to offer. We figured out when and where we would meet and how many patches she wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had an appointment with my therapist at that day and had to go to work right after. At the time, I couldn't drive because my license was suspended, so my uncle drove and waited for me. My phone kept going off during my appointment — it was Sasha. We had agreed to meet outside my therapist's office so I could sell her the patches before I left for work. As my uncle and I were walking out to his car, I told him I saw my friend and that I was going to go talk to her really quick.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the car Sasha was in and got inside. We talked for a bit, I handed her what she wanted, and she handed me the money. We went our separate ways — she went back to the city she lived in, and I went on to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried texting her all afternoon and into the night, but I never got a response. The last text I sent her, jokingly, was, \"Are you dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, I saw the posts on Sasha's Facebook wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP\n",
      "\n",
      "I miss you\n",
      "\n",
      "I love you\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in denial. How could this happen? I wondered. How DID this happen? I told myself it was just a coincidence — she must have done some other drugs. A mutual friend said she thought she OD'd from meth. I knew that wasn't possible, but I let it go and let it calm my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, in May, Sasha's family had a memorial for her. They had cremated her and wanted to celebrate her life when the weather was nicer. They planted a tree in her honor. It was bright and beautiful, like she was. I went, and I was numb the whole time. It wasn't real to me. I felt awkward when I approached her parents to give them my condolences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June, I decided to get a tattoo in her memory: three candy hearts with \"Love you\" in the first heart, \"Miss you\" in the second heart, and her initials with \"RIP\" underneath in the last heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "One July morning, as I walked out of the house to go to work, two men approached me and one of them said my full name.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood there looking at them. My whole body felt weak, and I knew my face had gone pale. The man went on to say things about selling Sasha the patches, and then he told me I was under arrest. They followed me into my house to let me drop off my purse and wake up my dad up to inform him I was being taken into custody by the federal agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived at the U.S. Marshals office, I was interviewed, and I cried the entire time. Then they took me to get processed; they took a swab of my DNA, fingerprinted me, took a mugshot, and got other personal information. I was told to undress, take my piercings out and do the whole nine yards, including the squat and cough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited for what felt like hours before my court-appointed lawyer arrived. He talked to me for a couple minutes, and then I was taken into the courtroom where they did the initial hearing. I stood there in shackles and handcuffed, crying hysterically. I was released on a bond to my parents with them being my third-party custodians.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next year, I would be drug-tested, see my therapist twice a month and my psychiatrist monthly, be in various group therapies for both mental health and drug addiction, go to the probation office for monthly visits, and have home visits from my probation officer. I wouldn't leave the house unless I had to for appointments or if accompanied by one of my parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following March, I pleaded guilty to one of my charges. I was told I would be sentenced mid-summer. I went to a meeting they held at the courthouse for offenders expecting to go to prison so I could learn what to anticipate when I got there. They mentioned things like how to deal with other inmates, correctional officers, and rules, contraband, etc. I was the only female in attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The July weekend before sentencing was all about relaxing and just enjoying the presence of the ones I love. I spent my last free Friday with my best friend and her mom, playing Blokus. The next day, I watch movies on ABC Family with my mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of Tuesday, July 29, 2014, I woke up and got ready for court. I was shaking with anxiety and had taken all the medication I had to help with it. My mom dropped me off at the probation office so I could do my last urine test and talk with my probation officer. Then I walked to the courthouse and talked with my lawyer before court was in session.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 9 a.m., I had my best friend, her mother, my mom, dad, sister, godfather and his dad all supporting me in the courtroom. My best friend gave me a crystal that was supposed to help with legal problems and negative outcomes. My godfather gave me a coin that had a saint on it for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole procedure lasted about an hour. I was given time to express remorse about my crime. The prosecutor asked for 60 months, but my sentencing guidelines only called for 6 to 12 months in prison. The judge said that although my crime involved a death, I was being sentenced only for distribution. He ended up giving me an upward variance, and I received a 21-month prison sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the last couple of years, I've learned a lot — that addiction can destroy your life. I went from being a stable college student with a job and my own place to an unstable drug addict with no job, sleeping with dealers or stealing money from my family to fuel my habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize now that even though I made a huge mistake, I can move on and become a better person. I am a felon in the eyes of the government, but that is not all of who I am. I don't have to be stuck with a stigma. I can and will be what I want to be.\n",

      "Bloomberg Takes on Trump and Sanders in Commencement Speech\n",
      "Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who considered a presidential run this year, blasted the partisan politics and “demagoguery” of the 2016 race in a commencement speech on Saturday, making reference to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this year’s presidential election, we’ve seen more demagoguery from both parties than I can remember in my lifetime,” the billionaire businessman said, in a column adapted from his remarks at the University of Michigan. “Our country is facing serious and difficult challenges. But rather than offering realistic solutions, candidates in both parties are blaming our problems on easy targets who breed resentment. For Republicans, it’s Mexicans here illegally and Muslims. And for Democrats, it’s the wealthy and Wall Street. The truth is: We cannot solve the problems we face by blaming anyone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, the Republican front-runner, has repeatedly promised to build a border wall and get Mexico to pay for it and has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Sanders, a Democratic candidate, has repeatedly targeted Wall Street and the “billionaire class.” Both he and Hillary Clinton have said they will reform big financial institutions if elected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloomberg—who has previously affiliated as both a Republican and Democrat and was considering a run for president as an Independent candidate—criticized “extreme partisanship” and “disturbing” intolerance for other political views in the U.S. and warned that “demagogues are always lurking.” He called on politicians to offer practical solutions instead of “scapegoats or pie-in-the-sky promises.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every generation has had to confront its own demagogues. And every generation has stood up and kept them away from the White House. At least so far,” he said. “Today, when a populist candidate promises free college, free health care and a pony, or another candidate promises to make other countries pay for our needs, remember: Those who promise you a free lunch will invariably eat you for breakfast.”\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s a plan that Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been concocting for years, first introducing the notion to the public in 2013. The two-part procedure is composed of HEAVEN (head anastomosis venture) and Gemini (the subsequent spinal cord fusion), and was initially outlined in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Surgical Neurology International. Canavero presented at the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopaedic Surgeons’s 39th annual conference last year, where his speech about the ambitious procedure served as the keynote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole process involves 36 hours, 150 people (doctors, nurses, technicians, psychologists, and virtual reality engineers), and around $20 million. Valery Spiridonov, a 31-year-old Russian program manager suffering from the rare muscular atrophy disorder Werdnig-Hoffman disease, has already signed on to become the first patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Smart scalpel can distinguish between healthy and cancerous brain tissue during surgery\n",
      "\n",
      "So how will it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Canavero, there will be two surgical teams working at the same time. One will focus on Spiridonov, the living patient, while the other will focus on a donor’s body. The donor will be brain-dead and selected based on height, build, and immunotype. Both patients will be anesthetized and hooked up to breathing machines and electrodes to keep tabs on brain and heart activity. Then, Spiridonov will have his head nearly frozen — temporarily brain-dead himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, attending physicians will drain the blood from his brain, and flush it with a surgery solution. Tubes will be looped around major arteries and veins to stop blood flow, and then later removed to allow for circulation once the new body is attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the most important part of all — cutting both spinal cords. This will be done with a $200,000 diamond nanoblade, which comes from the University of Texas. Once Spiridonov’s head is no longer attached to his body, he’ll have to have a new body within one hour. All the necessary arteries and veins will be reconnected, and theoretically, the new blood flow will re-warm Spiridonov’s head. From there, the spinal cord segments will be fused in yet another novel procedure, and all severed muscles and skin will be sewn back together as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all goes according to plan, Spiridonov could be up and walking three to six months after surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, skeptics abound for the procedure, but the patient says that he’s willing to risk death to escape his current condition. “If he is going to die,” Canavero says, “he is the only one who can decide.” The procedure is currently slated to take place late next year.\n",

      "Apple’s 3D Touch is so last year, Microsoft is working on something even cooler\n",
      "Most of the interactions with our smartphones involve the display, so it’s no surprise that manufacturers are racing to come up with newer technologies to make it easier to navigate our little pocket computers. Apple introduced 3D Touch last year, which was a game changer for sure, but Microsoft Research is cooking up something you need to check out as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly enough, this new tech doesn’t even involve actually touching the display. We’ve see this before with Samsung’s Air View, but it appears Microsoft is investing a little more attention to the details. It’s not about navigating your phone without ever touching the display. It’s more about making things more efficient when you actually do touch it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of this tech is a self-capacitive touchscreen that detects your fingers as they approach the display. Past renditions of this type of tech used either the front-facing camera or ultrasound, but Microsoft’s version uses the display itself. The advantage to this is that multitouch can take place above the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It uses what Microsoft refers to as anticipatory techniques to detect the grip and the approach of the fingers to adapt the interface. For example, if you’re watching a video, the control options will show up on the display as your finger(s) approach the screen. You can then tap the pause button with one touch. Normally you would have to tap the screen with one finger in order to get the controls to appear, and tap it again to pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft takes this a step further by modifying how the controls appear based on how you’re holding the device. If you happen to be holding your phone with one hand and attempting to control it with the same hand, the controls on the display will appear in a different spot to make it easier. It can also adapt to whether it’s your right or left hand that you’re using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s 3D Touch differs in that the display on the iPhone 6S or 6S Plus detects how hard you’re pressing. A light touch might offer a preview of a particular email, while a harder touch would actually open the email in full view. Microsoft’s pre-touch display senses your movements, and even how your holding the device, to provide the appropriate options before you place your finger(s) on the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video above also demonstrates how the Web browsing experience can be enhanced. Hyperlinks will only appear if you approach the display with one finger, but navigation controls will appear if there are multiple fingers. The display also detects a touch with a rapid move as a flick, but a touch involving a slower motion could be used for highlighting text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft was rumored to be working on something similar to 3D Touch for a Windows Phone called the McClaren. Supposedly that phone was scrapped, and it’s possible that the Redmond company shifted its efforts to providing this pre-touch feature. The video above most likely depicts a prototype phone for testing, not necessarily an actual upcoming model.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won’t be surprised if Microsoft uses pre-touch tech on both smartphones and Surface tablets, but unfortunately we have no idea when. It’s also possible that it never comes to market, but it looks too cool to put on the back burner.\n",

      "4 Lies We Tell Ourselves That Can Sabotage Our Retirement\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We like to think it’s things beyond our control—job layoffs, market downturns, big unanticipated expenses—that undermine our planning efforts and make achieving a secure retirement such a challenge. But the truth is we often inflict the most serious damage on our own by deluding ourselves into believing we’re making reasonable decisions when we’re not. Here are four examples of the kind of lies we tell ourselves (or, for a more charitable spin, the excuses we make) that can can dramatically sabotage our chances of retirement success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lie #1: I can’t afford to save now, but I’ll definitely get serious in the future. The problem with this justification is that it may take longer to get started than you think, as demonstrated in a recent Prudential TV commercial featuring Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert. The spot opens with a shot of a big blue wall that shows the ages 20 to 45 depicted on a vertical scale in five-year increments. Gilbert asks a group of young people put a paint mark on the wall at the age they think they should start saving for retirement. He then asks an older group to mark the age at which they actually started to save. The idea is to visually portray the retirement savings “action gap”—the difference between when we know we ought to start saving and when we eventually get around to it. In this case, based on a survey of more than 2,500 people done before the shoot, that gap was six years, with the youngsters saying they should start at age 26 on average and the oldsters having launched their savings effort at 32.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think getting a late start saving for retirement of just six years is no biggie, think again. A 26-year-old who makes $40,000 a year, gets 2% annual raises, saves 15% of yearly pay and earns 6% annually on his savings would accumulate a nest egg of just under $1.2 million by age 65. If that person waits six years until age 32 to get started, his nest egg would total roughly $855,000. That’s $345,000, or almost 30%, less for missing just those initial six years. If our fictional 26-year-old holds off 10 years until age 36, the nest egg shrinks to $685,000, some $515,000, or nearly 45%, less than with the early start. As Gilbert says in the commercial, “This gap between when we should start saving and when we do is one of the reasons why too many of us aren’t prepared for retirement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lie #2: If I fall behind, I’ll make up for it with higher investment returns. This rationale sounds convincing enough, but it implies you have control over how much your investments earn. News flash: You don’t. While you likely can improve investing results by sticking to low-cost index funds, you’re still pretty much at the mercy of whatever raw returns the financial markets deliver, which many pros expect to be considerably lower than there were in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, you can try shooting for higher gains by, say, increasing the percentage of your portfolio you invest in stocks or by channeling more of your money into high-octane investments like technology and emerging market shares, bu doing so necessarily means taking on more risk and dramatically increasing the chance of your investing strategy going badly awry. In short, anyone who thinks he can count on his investing prowess to make up for poor retirement planning is deceiving himself or simply doesn’t understand how the financial markets work. Either way, he’s playing a dangerous game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sign up for and more view example\n",
      "\n",
      "Lie #3: I don’t need to do a full-fledged retirement check-up. I have a pretty good feel for where I stand without crunching the numbers. Really? So you can assess in your head how much the savings you’ve already accumulated will grow between now and the time you retire plus how much you’ll save over the rest of your career will add to that amount, and then gauge the probability that that the sum of those figures will be able to support you over a retirement that could last upward of 30 years. Just when did you receive your Nobel Prize in economics?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact is, the only way you can realistically gauge whether you’re on track toward a secure retirement—or, if you’re already retired, see whether you’re spending down your nest egg at a sustainable rate—is to plug information about your savings and investments into a retirement income calculator that can estimate your odds of retirement success (or hire an adviser who can do the analysis for you).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even that won’t guarantee 100% accuracy. After all, we’re talking about projections, which are inherently squishy, especially when so many variables (how the markets will perform, whether you’ll meet your saving and spending targets, how long you’ll live) are involved. But by doing this sort of analysis and then repeating it periodically—say, every year or so—you’ll be able to get a sense of whether you’re moving closer or farther away from your goal and then make gradual adjustments, if necessary, to get back on course.\n",
      "\n",
      "More From RealDealRetirement.com: How Does The 4% Rule Work—And Should You Follow It?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lie #4: If all else fails, I’ll just work in retirement. Again, this assertion seems plausible at first glance. Indeed, the Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey reports that 67% of workers are planning to work for pay in retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just as there’s a disconnect between when people say they’ll start saving for retirement and when they actually do, so too is there a gap between the number of people who claim they’ll work in retirement and how many actually do. And in fact, the EBRI survey finds that only 27% of retirees have actually worked for pay in retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculator: Are my current retirement savings sufficient?\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s not to say that future retirees might not act differently, if for no other reason that these days retirees can easily shop for jobs by going to sites such as RetiredBrains.com and Retirementjobs.com. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll find a job that you enjoy or that pays as much as you’d like, or that you’ll be as eager to hold down a retirement job as you thought you would be before you retired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: Working periodically or part-time can be an excellent way to raise some extra spending cash and stay more socially engaged. But working is a better solution if you’re doing it because you really want to, not because you no other choice.\n",

      "\n",
      "This lynching occurred around 9pm after Jimmy Wade and his son, Jimmy Jr,. watched Sunday afternoon baseball and then went to the pharmacy on the square to get an ice cream. They were sitting on a bench on the side of their house across the street from the church listening to vespers, since it was hot and the windows were open. JWSr. liked to sit outside and listen rather than go in the church, while his wife and daughter were inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 9pm, a black sedan with four men inside pulled up alongside the father and son. Sheriff Jim T. Scott got out of the car and told JWSr. to get in. The other white men in the car were Mr. Strickland (the owner of Strickland Grocery who accused JWSr. of attempting to rape his wife), my grandfather Joe Oscar Hill, and another man, unknown. They took JWSr. to a field behind the Strickland home where they castrated him, dragged him behind the sedan by a rope, and shot him 20 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the death certificate and article, I am also including a transcription of a conversation I had with Jimmy Wade Jr. in 2008 [PDF]. He lives in Detroit. JWJr. told me that 6/29—the day of JWSr.’s death—was his sister Margaret’s birthday and she never celebrated her birthday again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also spoke with his older half-sister, Mary Sue Wade, who was an adult at the time [PDF]. Here’s how she described JWSr.’s wounds:\n",
      "\n",
      "Both forearms were broken in defensive wounds. The back of his head crushed. Shot through the wallet in his breast pocket into his heart. The pocket had powder burns and pieces of the wallet were found in his heart. They cut him down where his private clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lynching terrifies the black community even to this day. People remember it and don’t feel safe. Hattye Yarbrough, JWJr.’s elementary teacher at the Fraser School, described how she felt:\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared my feelings with very few people because I didn’t know how others felt, but not a lot of people talked about this. I was told I would lose my job.\n",

      "Why Ted Cruz's Big Gamble Failed\n",
      "You could tell when Ted Cruz started speaking in the past tense that he had finally come to grips with the inevitable. Standing in front of a bank of flags, surrounded by family who had gathered for a final stand in Indiana, the Texas Senator dropped his bid for the White House on Tuesday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We left it all on the field,” Cruz told supporters with evident sorrow. “But the voters chose another path. And so, with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of his regret go back to the gamble that has defined his political career. Since running for the Senate in 2012, Cruz has wagered that the way to win the White House was to run as an uncompromising conservative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every Republican strategist agrees the party’s salvation depends on broadening its appeal—a move so necessary and obvious that the Republican National Committee codified it in a report after the 2012 campaign. That means running as a classic center-right conservative in the primary, then pivoting to the middle for the general election. Cruz ripped up the rulebook, running a base-turnout campaign from the start, counting on evangelical and very conservative voters who allegedly sat out elections contested by milquetoast candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz argued that his absolutist brand of politics would raise a hidden “conservative army,” consisting of Americans who stayed home in 2008 and 2012. More than 50 million self-described evangelical voters stayed home when the GOP nominated Mitt Romney, Cruz claimed, arguing the party needed a candidate who would campaign “in bold colors, not pale pastels,” a phrase borrowed from Ronald Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, on issue after issue, Cruz staked out stances that no one on the right could outflank. He framed himself as a true believer in God and guns, went populist to capture grassroots unrest, led the effort to shut down the federal government in a doomed bid to gut Obamacare. He painted Republican colleagues as squishes, even calling Republican leader Mitch McConnell a liar. It’s de rigueur to rail against the Washington elites from the green rooms and gilded halls of the Capitol. It’s another thing to try to win the Republican nomination by running against the GOP. It led to Cruz becoming the most hated man in Washington, a point of pride he touted on the eve of the Iowa caucuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for a while, it looked like a canny calculation. But there was a flaw at the heart of this theory of the case. The conservative army that Cruz promised to unleashed proved to be a myth. Cruz traveled the country in 2014 and 2015 telling tall tales of the millions of evangelical and very conservative white voters who stayed home in 2012. But poll after poll, and results in state after state, failed to dredge up any evidence for the theory. Evangelicals turned out in record numbers for Mitt Romney. There were few hidden soldiers waiting to be conscripted in what Cruz fondly referred to as the flyover counties of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz misread the mood of the voters who were out there, and then courted them poorly. (Another political rule: the most likeable candidate usually wins.) As Trump was running up the vote tally in the Rust Belt, promising factory jobs were coming home, Cruz stuck with his that’s-not-government’s-job position. Trump riled crowds about immigrants; Cruz quoted the Founding Fathers. Trump pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border while Cruz promised to move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump campaigned with celebrity coach Bobby Knight; Cruz rallied with talk-radio host Glenn Beck. Cruz kicked off his campaign at evangelical Liberty University and Trump announced his candidacy in the gold-plated lobby of his Manhattan skyscraper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Politics has never been a purity test—even if it often seemed that way during the halcyon days of the Tea Party. And in 2016, the voters who fueled the conservative uprising were more interested in a candidate who could channel their anger than rhapsodize about the Constitution. How else to explain the mystery of why evangelical voters were choosing a thrice-married libertine who characterized navigating the Manhattan singles scenes without contracting a sexually transmitted disease as “my personal Vietnam?” Trump trounced Cruz across the Deep South—territory the Texan banked on winning—where even the godly worshipped at the Church of The Donald.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, there were signs that the self-styled true believer was more malleable than he let on. An early indication came in his brief flirtation with the strain of non-interventionist foreign policy. Not long ago, Cruz was joining Rand Paul’s filibuster against the Obama administration’s drone policy. As his party’s hawkish leanings resurfaced, Cruz saw the shift and promised he would bomb the Islamic State until the desert sand glowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivals began poking holes in the Texan’s narrative of unswerving principle. You can trace the beginning of his undoing to the night of his triumph in Iowa, when aides spread false reports to caucus-goers that Tea Party darling Ben Carson was preparing to exit the race. Cruz eked out a victory, but the seeds of a new storyline had been planted. Carson wouldn’t let the matter go. Marco Rubio spent the South Carolina primary assailing Cruz for running a campaign of “dirty tricks.” Trump tagged the Texan with a nickname, “Lyin’ Ted,” that seemed silly until it stuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "By casting himself as an agent of conservative purity, Cruz left himself little room for error or tactical changes. As he crisscrossed Iowa, Cruz’s favorability was the highest in the field—a staggering +45, according to Gallup. Three months later, he is underwater, a full 20 points behind Trump. Cruz’s standing inside the party also fell, something fellow Senators didn’t think possible. Before the Florida primary, Cruz and his allies invested more than $1 million and rolled out the endorsement of former HP CEO Carly Fiorina in the state to ensure Marco Rubio lost. He forced an “I win, or you lose” choice for the GOP, ensuring the party would be stuck with Trump if it didn’t rally around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz long insisted that he could beat Trump in a one-on-one contest. He got his wish in Indiana. In a makeshift alliance, Ohio Gov. John Kasich pulled out of the state. Cruz’s forces poured money into the state, blanketing the airwaves and winning the grudging support of Hoosier Gov. Mike Pence. Cruz allies and Trump foes spent almost $6 million on television ads. He even named a running mate, Carly Fiorina, in a gambit to shake up the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of it worked. Cruz crisscrossed the small towns with the grave manner and overwrought diction of a revival pastor from another century. His emphasis on where transgender citizens use the bathroom horrified party strategists and stirred sour memories in a state still reeling from its recent battle over a religious freedom law. It was one thing when Cruz got thumped in New York, whose values he criticized to score points. But large swaths of Indiana look a lot like Iowa on Sunday mornings, and the faithful were nowhere to be found. They simply were tired of fighting the culture wars Cruz seemed eager to lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Cruz’s earliest decision—to treat his colleagues in the Capitol as foils instead of friends—came back to bite him. The #NeverTrump movement that conservatives launched to thwart the brash billionaire was never going to work when the primary alternative was a guy who much of the party detested. When former House Speaker John Boehner—ousted by the chamber’s arch-conservative Freedom Caucus, which took cues from Cruz—chose the day of Fiorina’s announcement to liken the freshman Texan to “Lucifer,” it seemed less a hot-headed jab than ice-cold revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruz’s final act in Indiana was to deliver a blistering critique of Trump. He called him a pathological liar, a philanderer, a narcissist, and “utterly amoral.” This was a candidate whom Cruz courted and complimented for months. “Donald Trump is terrific,” Cruz tweeted in December. Now Cruz was unloading, telling voters “what I really think.” Voters were left to infer that Trump was right: the self-styled truthteller (slogan: “TrusTed”) had dissembled for months because he thought the détente worked to his benefit. The candidate had finally let the mask slip, a rare moment of candor in a disciplined campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after dropping out, Cruz is well-positioned for a second try in 2020. His is a party with a history of nominating the runner-up the next time around. He began to lay that groundwork on Tuesday, with a farewell speech inspired by Ronald Reagan’s concession at the last contested convention in 1976. As flawed as his audacious gamble may have been, it transformed a first-term Senator with few powerful allies into a serious contender for the GOP presidential nomination. Cruz won 11 primaries and caucuses, raised gobs of cash from donors big and small, and ran the most technically savvy Republican campaign of 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Cruz played the hand he chose about as well as he could. It just wasn’t as strong a hand as he thought.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(BOULDER, Colo.) — A judge sentenced a Colorado woman who cut a baby from a stranger’s womb to 100 years in prison, including the maximum penalties for attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Maria Berkenkotter said the harshest sentences for the most serious charges were justified by the brutality of the 2015 attack, which she described as performing a cesarean with a kitchen knife. Berkenkotter also said the victim, Michelle Wilkins, as well as her family and the community needed Dynel Lane, 36, to express remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane murmured a “no” when the judge asked if she wanted to speak Friday. Lane also did not speak in her defense during her trial, which ended in February when jurors found her guilty of attempting to kill Wilkins after luring her victim to her home with an ad for maternity clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jurors had heard that Lane went to elaborate lengths to feign her own pregnancy before attacking Wilkins. They did not hear that in 2002, Lane’s 19-month-old son drowned in what investigators ruled was an accident. Relatives who spoke on Lane’s behalf before the sentencing Friday said her remorse over losing her son may have led her to take an action they could not understand or explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane’s attorneys did not dispute that she attacked Wilkins, but they argued there was no evidence it was a calculated murder attempt. They urged jurors to convict Lane of the lesser charge of attempted manslaughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berkenkotter sentenced Lane to 48 years for attempted murder and 32 years for unlawful termination of a pregnancy. The remainder of her sentence was for assault charges in the attack. She was given credit for the more than a year she has served since her arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kathryn Herold, the public defender representing Lane, told the judge Friday she would appeal and that Lane had the right not to speak. Berkenkotter acknowledged that was Lane’s constitutional right. But the judge said that in weighing her sentence she had to take into account that “people are hungry to hear from you, Miss Lane. Hungry, desperate to hear you express genuine remorse from the bottom of your heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors said they were unable to charge Lane with murdering Wilkins’ unborn girl because a coroner found no evidence the fetus lived outside the womb. That led Colorado Republicans to introduce legislation that would have allowed a murder charge. Democrats rejected the measure, the third time such a proposal failed in Colorado. Over the objection of abortion-rights supporters, 38 states have made a fetus’ killing a homicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilkins focused on her unborn daughter Friday. She placed a large photograph of her dead baby, who appeared to be sleeping, on an easel next to the witness stand, then asked Berkenkotter to impose the harshest possible sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilkins said after the sentencing that she saw the hearing as a day in court for her daughter, who she named Aurora.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judge Berkenkotter was clearly listening to everything that we were saying,” Wilkins told reporters, adding she felt justice had been served.\n",
      "\n",
      "In court, Wilkins had directed her words to Lane, who sat straight and showed no emotion as her victim spoke. Lane cried later in the hearing when a letter from one of her two daughters expressing love was read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane’s mother apologized in court to Wilkins and her family, as did her father in a letter his wife read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane had posted online photos of herself with a distended belly and sent the man she said was the father of her child ultrasound images downloaded from the Internet. David Ridley, who lived with Lane and her two daughters, testified at trial that Lane claimed for more than a year that she was expecting a boy, whom they planned to name James. Friends even threw a baby shower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ridley had grown suspicious by the time Lane lured Wilkins to her Longmont home. Wilkins testified they chatted for about an hour before Lane hit, pushed and tried to choke her, then used two kitchen knives to cut the baby from her womb.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ridley came home early from work that day to meet Lane for a doctor’s appointment, he said he found the fetus in a bathtub and drove the child and Lane to a hospital, where she begged staff to save her baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane said nothing to Ridley about Wilkins, who was unconscious at her home. Wilkins regained consciousness and called police.\n",

      "One of the longest-standing traditions in the Faroe Islands — massive, lush green mounts that jut out of the North Atlantic, between Norway and Iceland — is whale hunting. Many outsiders find the hunt appalling, the way the blood of the hunt reddens the sea, but Katie Currid feels differently. The American-born, Europe-residing photographer captured these images of the whale hunt in the summer of 2011, and describes it as “one of the most amazing things I’ve ever been a part of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What Currid saw in the hunt — and what we think these photos convey, in all their gory glory — was the coming together of a community in the aftermath of a hunt, to sort and share the meat and to help feed one another. To Currid, much of the outrage over the hunt is unwarranted. The pilot whales are not endangered, they spent their lives free in the ocean and they’re killed swiftly. We don’t generally put up the same fuss over large-scale beef factories, she points out. Ultimately, the whale hunt disturbs us, she argues, because people don’t “realize that the life of an animal is a byproduct of their dinner.”\n",

      "[Updated] New Footage of the 2 Teens Lost at Sea Emerges\n",
      "Longtime friends Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos, both of whom would now be 15, have been missing since July 24 when they took a fishing boat off the coast of Florida's Jupiter Inlet. Though their boat was found stranded 100 miles off the coast of Bermuda last month, investigators are just now uncovering clues that lead them to believe there may have been foul play involved in the boys' disappearance, NBC News reports.\n",

      "With the boat's discovery, Austin's iPhone was found. Perry's parents are now suing Austin's parents for refusing to give the phone (which was heavily damaged by saltwater) over to third-party investigators to see if they can uncover any more information from their sons' last interactions. Perry's phone was broken when the boys' left, so they agreed to share use of Austin's phone while on the boat, Perry's mother argues, and because of that, the phone is half hers. She believes she will \"continue to suffer irreparable harm if the iPhone is not properly handled as material evidence in a possible maritime crime or homicide.\"\n",

      "According to PEOPLE, several of Perry and Austin's friends report receiving Snapchats from them off the Jupiter coast that morning with the words \"We're F'd\" on them, though it's unclear what time the snaps were sent. The boys also reportedly sent \"I love you\" and \"Just checking in\" texts to their parents respectively while on the boat that morning. One missing persons report claimed there was a picture from that day on Austin's Instagram account captioned, \"Peace out Jupiter,\" and specified that several other friends said the boys told them they were planning to fish \"far off shore\" for dolphins before they left. Cell phone records indicate Austin's phone was within inshore waters at 12:02 p.m. that day. At 1:30 p.m., a storm with winds up to 40 miles an hour hit the Jupiter area.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boat was being packed up to be sent back to Florida, WPBF reports investigators noticed the boat's battery had been switched off. \"We do know for sure that boat was disabled intentionally because the battery switch, which is very difficult to get to, was in the off position. That can't be maneuvered by the passage of time, the current, and other events,\" the Cohen's lawyer Guy Rubin told WPBF. \"If the storm came and capsized the boat, the battery switch and the key would not be in those positions.\" While it's possible the boys turned the battery off to conserve battery if they knew they were in trouble with the storm, it's also possible someone tampered with the boat before they left.\n",

      "The woman who could theoretically undergo the impossible task of following up Michelle Obama as First Lady of the United States was the subject of a GQ profile today, and it is pretty much what you would expect from someone who is married to Donald Trump. Below, a few things we learned:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Her Dior wedding dress took 550 hours to make, included 1,500 cyrstals, and cost $100,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Speaking of their wedding, the cake was five feet tall, and made of Grand Marnier.\n",
      "\n",
      "- She's \"great at picking out china patterns,\" according to a stylist who has worked with the Trumps, which is either a mediocre compliment or a very rude diss.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Of her 10-year-old son, Barron, she says, \"He's not a sweatpants child.\" She also wants him to someday be a \"businessman and golfer.\" Seems attainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Donald Trump has never heard his wife \"fart or make a doodie,\" according to Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Her first few years in New York sounded pretty miserable, according to this paragraph: \"In New York, Melania lived a quiet, homebound life, taking assiduous care of her body: walks with ankle weights, seven pieces of fruit every day, diligently moisturizing her skin. She rarely partied, never brought anyone back to the apartment, and was always home early.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- Her caviar-infused anti-aging creams aren't selling very well, though her line of \"affordable gem-spangled jewelry and watches\" for QVC is.\n",
      "\n",
      "- She does not Botox. \"I think it's damaging your face, damaging your nerves,\" she says. \"It's all me. I will age gracefully, as my mom does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- A friend from Slovenia who wisely asked to remain anonymous described her thusly: \"She's not stupid, she's not a bimbo, but she's not especially clever.\"\n",

      "This week, as investigators look into Prince's tragic death at the age of 57, new details have emerged that appear to paint a tragic picture. Two days ago, investigators told the media that they are focusing on the role that painkillers might have played in the musician's death. This news came shortly after a TMZ report claimed that Prince's emergency landing days before his death was caused by a drug overdose. Today, the county sheriff investigating the death has asked for help from the Drug Enforcement Administration, as prescription painkillers were found in Prince's possession when he died.\n",

      "An autopsy was conducted last week, but the medical examiner said it will take weeks for the cause of death to be confirmed, and officials have not said what role the painkillers played in Prince's collapse in his Minneapolis house.\n",

While Wolverine succeeded in his mission and returned to the present day, his unconscious body in the past was retrieved by a William Stryker-impersonating Mystique. As Mystique appears to be one of the leaders of the X-Men, we could see Wolverine appear as a feral trump card in the battle against Apocalypse.

The road's speed limit is 55 miles per hour. McGee allegedly told the passengers in her car who were concerned about her speed (one of whom is pregnant) that she was \"just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat\" while filming in selfie mode with the speed filter on.\n",

According to the photographer, the hobby was once used as a form of psychological escape from Iron Curtain dictatorships.

      "As we find out more about Prince's endearingly regular habits in his hometown of Chanhassen, Minnesota, a source tells ET that Prince would often rent out the local theater after midnight, so that he and few of his close friends could catch the latest films.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as they weren't R rated, that is. The source says that the \"Purple Rain\" singer would only see films rated PG-13 and below, and he would always call the day of to let the manager know how many people he would be coming with -- which sometimes, would only be his bodyguard and another friend. His last theater outing was in March, when he screened the animated film Zootopia.\n",

      "\"He looked great, like he normally does,\" the source said about the last time Prince was at the theater. \"I was absolutely shocked when I heard what happened.\"\n",

      "By all accounts, Prince was a fairly normal theatergoer, buying a water, and occasionally popcorn or peanut M&Ms to snack on, but he definitely had a playful side.\n",

      "\"Recently, he hid around a corner and popped out to scare his friends,\" the source recalls. \"He was laughing and seemed like a really normal guy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, he took precautions to stay private. He mostly rented screening rooms after midnight, so as not to cause a scene. He would also wear a wig, sunglasses, hats and scarves, in an attempt to go unnoticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A noted night owl, Prince would also often go to the upscale supermarket Lunds & Bverlys either really late at night or early in the morning, another source tells ET. The legendary musician was similarly very private during these outings, coming dressed in a disguise and ordering groceries to be delivered to his Paisley Park estate.\n",

      "The whole point of rollercoasters is that they can terrify or thrill you without actually putting you in any real danger. But that wasn’t exactly the case when Delbert Latham and his six-year-old son, Kaysen, boarded the Mousetrap rollercoaster at Wonderland Amusement Park in Amarillo, Texas this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to local news affiliate KVII, the father and son were aboard the rollercoaster for the second time that day when Latham decided to film their ride experience to share with his wife. But as they hit the rollercoaster’s first drop, Kaysen’s seatbelt failed, causing him to fall into the bottom of the cart. Without realizing he was still filming, Latham grabbed his son and held him for the rest of the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve got you,” Latham tells Kaysen. “You’re fine. I promise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaysen appears pretty shaken after the experience, but stayed calm throughout the rest of the ride with his dad’s reassurance that everything would be okay. Once the two left the ride, Latham notified a park employee of the seatbelt malfunction only to be told that the problem had been “happening sometimes.” Immediately afterwards, more parkgoers were loaded onto the ride (although not in the seat the Lathams had just occupied).\n",

      "“That’s when it made me more angry,” Latham told reporters.\n",

      "Why Your Uber Driver Now Expects a Tip on Top of the Fare\n",
      "The concept of tipping has been in flux recently. Some restaurants have killed off tipping to simplify the customer experience and give their employees a living wage. At the same time there's been \" tip creep \" in the countless coffeeshops that use the Square payment platform, which pressures customers into tipping by having them actively select \"no tip\" on a screen everyone behind them can see.\n",
      "\n",
      "One category that has seen tipping recede is transportation. Although Lyft's platform has tipping as an option, the rise of Uber has left consumers with a simplified this-is-the-price payment model. The company's help page states explicitly that \"there's no need to tip.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tip-free party for Uber riders looks to be over, however. Last week the company agreed to pay a $100 million settlement to drivers to stop them from becoming employees who are entitled to benefits like health insurance. While the main news was the fact that Uber drivers will be independent contractors in infinitum, there was just as much news in the driver agreement's details—which as the Wall Street Journal noted indicates that tipping on Uber rides could be the new norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Next: 15 Things You Didn’t Know About Tipping\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreement now allows drivers to post signs in the car letting customers know that tipping is not included . This notice implies that riders could--and probably should--add a tip for drivers, who have been experiencing fare cuts around the country during Uber promotional periods. Since Uber riders are rated by drivers, the drivers have a bit of leverage besides guilt. Leaving a bad tip or no tip at all could lead to a bad customer review--and down the road drivers could be inclined to pass on picking up riders who are known as bad tippers. Essentially, the change levels out a playing field that has been stacked against drivers considerably.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gratuities, however, will not come from within the app like with Lyft. Uber drivers will have to rely on cash for tips, and cash is not necessarily something your typical modern Uber passenger carries at all times. In fact, to many consumers, cash tipping is an annoying aspect of the process that the app-for-that industry was supposed to fix, and until Uber adds a tipping screen to its app, it appears Lyft enjoys an advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to tipping, the new driver agreement adds protections for the drivers against getting booted off the service for a 4-star rating—a bad rating, with Uber's warped five-star rating system—and allows drivers to decline fares with less impunity compared to the past.\n",

      "To some people, like Eric Spiegelman, president of the Los Angeles Taxicab Commission, this turn of events could be very bad for providing equal service to all since there would be less incentive for getting cars to pick people up in lower-income neighborhoods. The policy change basically allows drivers to avoid people they don't want to pick up—which could easily mean more discrimination.\n",

      "The Walking Dead: Why Negan's Kill Had To Be Glenn\n",
      "Every single person on the internet seems to have a thoroughly fleshed out theory on who died in the closing moments of The Walking Dead's season six finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Glenn, to Abraham, to Daryl, to Rosita - there's \"hard evidence\" to support every single theory. From now on, we're going to flesh out each one of those theories each day and let you decide which is most concrete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we'll start with Glenn Rhee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glenn being the victim of Negan's kill is probably the most popular theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason for Glenn being the popular theory is Negan's arrival in The Walking Dead comics. When he showed up, he offered a long monologue just like he did on the show (plus a whole lot of swearing) and concluded with the most vicious game of eenie-meenie-minie-moe imaginable. Ultimately, \"it\" was Glenn. Negan proceeded to bash Glenn's skull as everyone looked on in horror and he struggled to call out for his wife, \"Maggie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, The Walking Dead tends to swap deaths when adapting them to TV. For example, in the comics Tyreese got his head cut off while it waS Hershel on television and Abraham was killed by Dwight's arrow on the pages but it was Denise on TV. So, we're going to need more proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a story telling standpoint, Glenn makes the most sense. Losing the core character who found Rick and introduced him to this group in the first place would have a huge impact on Alexandria's perspective of Negan. He comes in and takes out a friend, a husband, and a soon-to-be father? Few other characters could spark more hatred for Negan as his victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's the audio some folks have analyzed. If the subtitles are indeed accurate, then Glenn is a sure-thing goner. Have a look and listen:\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis of the audio seems like the most substantial evidence condemning Glenn's fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, Glenn was on one far end of the nine-person line-up. Between Negan's \"You are\" and \"it\" lines, he took a considerable amount of steps and held a solid pause. This would seem to indicate that he was walking from one end to the other and finding either Eugene, who was on one end, or Glenn, who was on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's the fact that we saw the beating from the victim's perspective. Throughout the episode, we saw the perspective of a certain character from inside the van where Michonne, Rosita, Michonne, and Glenn were being held hostage. Rosita's death would have little impact on Alexandria. Rick would have interjected before allowing Michonne to be slaughtered. Daryl was too weakened by his gunshot to withstand a blow to his head and get back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Steven Yeun has committed to a new film titled, \"Mayhem.\" Mayhem films this month, just as The Walking Dead cast and crew head back to Atlanta to film the show's seventh season.\n",
      "\n",
      "By these standards, all signs point to Glenn being the victim of Negan's kill.\n",

      "Why the Russians Decided to Harass That U.S. Navy Destroyer This Week\n",
      "Earlier this week, the men and women aboard the USS Cook, a guided-missile destroyer operating on a training mission with Poland in the Baltic Sea, got a bit of an airshow: Two Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft buzzed their ship repeatedly, and then a Russian helicopter came sniffing around, too. CNN has good video of the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might seem like a simple case of a territorial pissing match. But let's not forget that the Russians have a long history of Maskirovka, or military deception, so it could be argued that one can never tell with them. Indeed, during the Cold War, there was an entire sub-industry in the West's intelligence community known as Sovietology, devoted to deciphering what the Soviets meant in each of their statements and actions. Nowadays it is a resurgent field, albeit under another name: Kremlinology.\n",

      "\n",
      "It should be made clear that this whole \"buzzing\" incident was essentially harmless. At almost any instant the USS Cook could have blown the planes from the sky—not just close in, but more than 100 miles out—without so much as a hiccup. All parties involved knew that. All parties also knew that Russia's actions were for media attention and provocation.\n",

Poland and Lithuania border it, and the city (and surrounding territory) is a \"Russian exclave,\" the equivalent of if we tucked Long Island somewhere inside of China's borders. This is one of Russia's only ports that can operate year-round. It is not attached to Mother Russia at all. Check a map.\n",

      "Apple Learns a Bitter Lesson in China\n",
      "The masters of the universe running Apple ( aapl ) have just discovered that the Celestial Kingdom is slipping out of their grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s recent decision to ban Apple from offering its iTunes Movies and iBooks Store services must have come as a shock to executives at the world’s most valuable company. As Apple’s second-largest market for iPhones, China is critical to the Cupertino-based company’s future. Total revenue from the Greater China region (which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) now accounts for about a quarter of Apple’s sales. And Apple has invested heavily in cultivating good relations with the Chinese government. CEO Tim Cook has visited China at least seven times since assuming his position in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does not seem to value such demonstrations of goodwill. The CCP seldom allows sentimentality to get in the way when a foreign company – even an old “friend of China” such as Apple—does something that arouses the party’s paranoia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this particular case, the digital books and movies offered by Apple are considered a potential threat to the Chinese government’s ongoing campaign of keeping out Western liberal ideas. In addition, the notion that Apple could dominate China’s digital content market must also have offended Beijing’s protectionist instincts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s unpleasant experience offers a warning to American tech giants eager to break into China. Facebook and Twitter, for instance, are currently blocked inside China, but both hope to get a piece of China’s vast Internet market in the future. What tech leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Cook need to learn is that no matter how hard they may try to convince Chinese leaders of their innocent intentions and the potential benefits of a partnership, they are unlikely to get anywhere. On a fundamental level, Beijing wants to keep foreign firms from dominating China’s information sector and from posing an existential threat to the CCP’s monopoly of power. China may have to pay a high price for such resistance. They may have to use inferior technology, products, and services. But such costs are considered affordable to the regime because they are borne almost exclusively by ordinary Chinese people.\n",
      "\n",
      "American companies face a dilemma, as China’s market is simply too big to ignore. If they do not try to curry favor from Chinese authorities, their competitors will. And ceding China to a rival is simply unthinkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driven by such considerations, Western companies, including American giants in all sectors, have adopted two principal strategies so far. The first is to demonstrate their commercial value to Beijing. The other is to establish rapport with Chinese leaders and build good guanxi (relations). Based on China’s recent turn toward protectionism and xenophobia, it looks like Western firms need to adopt a new approach to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any strategy that relies on the good will of Chinese authorities is dicey because of the arbitrary nature of the Chinese regime. A Western company that’s an “old friend” today could be a reviled “foreign devil” tomorrow if Beijing does not like what it is doing in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western companies ought to pursue a self-help strategy instead. The best source of such help is Washington. The Chinese government has signed many trade and commercial agreements with the U.S. and is a member of the World Trade Organization. U.S. firms should not hesitate to pressure Washington to hold Beijing to its commitments. China may have grown too powerful for most countries in the world to handle alone, but the U.S. retains sufficient clout to make China pay a heavy price if it treats American firms unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western companies should also band together. China plays the classic game of “divide and conquer” in dealing with Western companies, wooing some while bullying others. Regrettably, Western companies have been unable to form a united front, making themselves vulnerable to Beijing’s capriciousness. Individually, no Western firm, however successful or big, is a match for China. But China cannot afford to alienate a group of Western companies whose technologies, products, and services it sorely needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first step Apple should take is not to send Tim Cook to Beijing to plead its case. Kowtowing seldom works. Instead, Cook should take the lead in organizing other American companies with high stakes in the Chinese market to push back against Beijing’s opaque and arbitrary use of regulatory authority. Contrary to conventional wisdom counseling against public defiance toward Beijing, Apple and other American firms need to know that only collective action will get the attention of the Chinese government.\n",

      "Malia Obama Is Taking a Gap Year. It's an Increasingly Popular Move\n",
      "President Obama’s oldest daughter Malia will take a gap year before attending Harvard University, the White House announced Sunday. While the brief White House statement did not mention what the 17-year-old First Daughter would be doing during that time, Harvard happens to be one of many elite schools that encourages students to take a year off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harvard College encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way,” according to the website for the school’s admissions office. “Each year, between 80 and 110 students defer their matriculation to the College.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Princeton University offers a tuition-free, nine-month “Bridge Year” in which students can elect to do a service project outside of the U.S. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Tufts University (in Medford, Mass.) have similar programs, while one run by the New School in New York City offers up to a year’s worth of academic credit to participants. But in the last five years, the idea has been gaining more traction in the U.S.—particularly among Americans admitted to selective colleges and universities. The American Gap Association said that enrollment in gap-year programs rose 27% between 2012 and 2013. Higher education policy experts say that’s because there are more structured options on the market, including programs like AmeriCorps’s City Year, which provides a living stipend to students at U.S. public schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some small studies suggest that the time off may help prevent burnout, finding that students who take time off perform better academically than their peers who went straight to school. Gap-year students at Middlebury College “on average… have shown a clear pattern of having higher G.P.A.’s than would otherwise have been predicted, and the positive effect lasts over all four years,” former admissions dean Robert Clagett wrote in the New York Times. Yet other data may back up parents’ worst fear—that the gap year will make students less likely to graduate on time. As TIME previously reported, “a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, found that, all things being equal, those who delayed college by a year were 64% less likely to complete a bachelor’s degree than those who enrolled immediately after high school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Joe O’Sea, author of Gap Year: How Delaying College Changes People in Ways the World Needs and at one point the president of the American Gap Association, acknowledged in a 2015 op-ed for TIME that “we need more longitudinal studies on how to maximize student development and on the impact on communities where gap years are taken.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I mean, you think about all the years he was jumping off those risers,\" she recalls. \"They were not low -- they were very, very high -- and to jump off that ... First of all, the Purple Rain tour and the way that they were stacked, he had those heels on. We did a year of touring [and] for him to jump off of that -- just an entire year would have messed up his knees.\"\n",

      "\"He was in pain all the time, but he was a performer,\" she adds.\n",

      "\"It just kind of gradually happened, it wasn't forced,\" she says about how their relationship turned romantic. \"We just like a lot of the same things, and then things we didn't agree on were good things we were glad we didn't agree on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were both very competitive and always tried to outdo each other -- with everything from clothes to playing ping pong and basketball and pool, who could stay up the longest and record and, I mean, there's just a lot of crazy moments,\" she also recalls. \"This was 38 years of stuff with him.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I fell in love with his music, and then watching him perform onstage ... forget about it, it was over,\" she smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Prince's spiritual beliefs, Sheila E. says that they changed over the years. The \"Raspberry Beret\" singer was raised a Seventh-day Adventist and later became a Jehovah's Witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we were friends, his beliefs were different than what they are now, and that's part of change -- part of growing, part of searching and trying to find out,\" Sheila E. reflects. \"Did he find his purpose, you know, what does he believe in or what does he not believe in? He went through all of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of all, she remembers Prince's incredible work ethic, and his drive to always be better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did his homework. He created, he rehearsed, he practiced, he always gave it his all, 150 percent every time,\" she stresses. \"He expanded and continued to move forward. He never stayed in the same place musically. It was limitless, the things that he could write and create.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Please, Stop Calling Us Millennials\n",
      "Imagine sitting in a meeting where everyone’s talking about what YOU think … the collective “you” being that tech-savvy but supposedly lazy and entitled lot born between 1980 and 2000. You know, the M-word: millennials. This happens a lot to London-based marketing consultant Jessica Riches, whose colleagues — be they from Generations X,Y or Z — are forever trying to figure out how best to penetrate her generation’s heart (and, naturally, wallets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their best move, it turns out, may be in dropping the label altogether. A recent report on generational identification by the Pew Research Center reveals that:\n",
      "\n",
      "A surprising 60 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds don’t consider themselves part of the “millennial generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just over 40 percent of 27- to 34-year-olds, in fact, believe they’re Gen Xers, and of the younger ones — aged 18 to 26 — less than half see themselves as millennials. Did I hear you whisper “pain in the ass”? Every young generation’s been accused of being contradictory, but many millennials genuinely don’t identify with the term, and for good reason. Just 58 percent of them have even heard the term, says Alec Tyson, a senior researcher at Pew. That alone accounts for a lot of the disconnect, but there’s another factor: Every generation spans a relatively wide swath of ages, so this could “stem from a bit of understandable confusion about where the line is,” Tyson adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well-educated and media-savvy groups were most likely to be familiar with “millennials,” Tyson says, but even those who knew what it meant weren’t loving it. When asked how well the label described them personally, only 30 percent said it described them well. According to Tyson, “not many” millennials see this as a very important part of how they describe or think of themselves. Riches and many others of “that” generation seem to agree. “It’s hard to say whether we should be happy with the term … that appears to include so many things, but at the same time describes nothing at all,” she says, noting the contradictions. They’re described as entitled, for example, yet face huge debts; they’re lazy but entrepreneurial; and they’re expected to determine political outcomes, while also being apathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some also point to the fact that 20 years of births are too much for one umbrella, especially in the digital age. “There is a HUGE difference between millennials … born in 1985 and those born in 1995,” says Lauren Seward, 22, in San Francisco. Others, of course, simply hate the negative connotation. When her Gen X peers use the “M” term, many do so in a derogatory way, says Carrie Searing, a Washington-based 33-year-old who adds: “I take offense to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Millennials aren’t alone in generational-identification woes. Only 58 percent of Gen Xers see themselves as such, and a whopping 82 percent of the silent generation don’t appreciate the moniker. The M-word, by comparison, has been around only a short while and could catch on more widely as the generation ages, Tyson suggests. But the terms used to describe generations do matter, he adds, noting: “Who wants to be called ‘silent’?”\n",

      "The very first prototype is meant to demonstrate the potential of what will ultimately become a fleet of unmanned ships, known as Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessels (to be pronounced “active” for short). The 132 foot long vessel managed to log a top speed of 27 knots during its test in Portland, Oregon, and it’ll be ready for open seas this summer when it launches from the California coast. The drone ship’s official christening is fast approaching on April 7, and the Navy seems pretty excited by the prospects of “an unmanned vessel optimized to robustly track quiet diesel electric submarines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to tracking submarines, the ACTUV could prove useful in a number of additional operations.Everything from serving as a supplier to other ships, countering undersea mines, and aiding in the logistics of complex operations could be carried out with these unmanned vessels, especially given their ability to remain at sea for three months at a time without a human crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "In preliminary tests, the drone has successfully tracked a submarine from 1 kilometer away, which the Pentagon says is a major improvement in the technology. “Picking up the quiet hum of a battery-powered, diesel-electric submarine in busy coastal waters is like trying to identify the sound of a single car engine in the din of a major city,” said Rear Admiral Frank Drennan, commander of the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACTUV ships are also expected to help lower costs for the U.S. Navy, helping it save human capital and resources with this autonomous technology. It’s still unclear as to whether these water drones will be weaponized, but if you happen to see an unmanned vessel floating around the California coast this summer, don’t be alarmed. It’s just an ACTUV ship, waiting to do its duty.\n",

      "Who Flees Africa's North Korea for Sudan?\n",
      "Every day all over the world, people cross borders in search of a better life. But you know things are truly bad back home when you need to seek refuge in Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), however, that’s precisely the game plan for desperate citizens in one country on the Horn of Africa:\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 125,530 people from Eritrea have to fled to Sudan — and the UNHCR says this number is likely to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are fleeing the iron rule of Eritrea’s President Isaias Afwerki and his thick catalog of human rights violations, including (but not limited to) forced and indefinite military conscription, arbitrary arrests and torture. In fact, the autocratic East African country leads the world in only two grim categories: media censorship and child labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no wonder why so many young Eritreans (most refugees are age 18 to 24) try their luck in neighboring Ethiopia, which currently hosts more than 131,660 Eritrean refugees. According to UNHCR, 40,000 arrived in 2015, almost twice as many as the year before. Ethiopia is politically stable and has close cultural and historical ties to Eritrea, so refugees are well treated. Many, however, go to Sudan, where they can cross to Libya and take the dangerous passage to Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no future for anyone in Eritrea,” says Khalid, a 17-year-old from Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, who reached the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa after a 20-hour journey at sea from Libya. His older brother managed to get asylum in Switzerland, so that’s where he hopes to go next. Crossing the Mediterranean is a gamble with one’s life, but even Eritreans who stay in Sudan are not guaranteed their safety. Refugees often fall victim to smuggling, trafficking and rape. Human Rights Watch has reported cases of refugees being forcibly deported from Sudan back to the brutal regime from which they were fleeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When faced with a refugee crisis, a common response from developed nations is to try to improve refugees’ living conditions in the country of origin through diplomatic threats, aid packages or both. Unfortunately, neither of these strategies is likely to succeed in Eritrea, says Nicole Hirt, associate researcher at the GIGA Institute of African Affairs in Hamburg, Germany. The EU recently gave a $326 million aid package directly to Afwerki’s coffers with the hope of curbing the refugee influx. But Hirt believes “this will definitely not help. Instead, it will just contribute to extend the militarization of society.” Meanwhile, the government is actually benefiting from the growing diaspora through remittances and a 2 percent “diaspora tax” enforced by Eritrean embassies to citizens living abroad. (The government of Eritrea did not reply to requests for comment.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, Eritrea continues to grow so hostile to its own citizens that it can’t even hold onto its national soccer team. After the World Cup Qualifier in 2015, 10 of its players asked for asylum in Botswana — the fourth time such mass defection has happened.\n",

      "Shortly after photographer Tara Ruby released a series dedicated to working moms who breastfeed, one of the women's husband faced backlash at work. According to WNEM, a New Mexico firefighter may be put on unpaid leave because his wife was wearing his uniform while breastfeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesman for the Lac Cruces Fire Department told the station he could not comment on the matter, but that the city does not have a specific policy regarding breastfeeding. He also confirmed the fire department's \"policy on uniforms does not specifically mention spouses, nor is it clear whether or not spouses may wear uniforms,\" reports KUTV, so it's unclear what the actual issue with the photo is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruby told the Las Cruces Sun-News she's gotten an overwhelming amount of support for her series and she pointed out the inherent issue with punishing someone for this photo: \"They're not supporting the normalizing of breastfeeding … or supporting anyone coming in and breastfeeding in uniform. It just seems like it's a double standard. There's fireman costumes for Halloween — and that's OK? Or is it strictly because she was breastfeeding and that's the problem?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruby also told Cosmopolitan.com earlier this month she will continue posting pictures like these in order to fight said double-standard. \"You can work a full-time job and breastfeed and do both equally well. If this is supporting someone out there, then let's do it,\" she said.\n",

      "Not that there’s any need for further proof of tech’s diversity crisis, but if you were looking for some, consider your search ended. According to the CEO of Intel, the primary opposition to the company’s latest diversity and inclusion efforts has come from within the organization. Apparently, maintaining a homogeneous status quo is the chief priority of some Intel employees, leading to “a bit of a backlash” and even threats directed at Intel’s leadership. So yeah, there’s a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the PUSHTech 2020 conference on Saturday with Reverend Jesse Jackson in San Francisco, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich admitted that not everyone at his tech firm has been excited about the recent efforts to increase the proportion of underrepresented minorities at the company and in the industry at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People worry that as a white man, you’re kind of under siege to a certain extent,” Krzanich said. “There’s been a bit of resistance. We’ve even had a few threats and things like that on some of our leadership team around our position on diversity and inclusion. We stand up there and just remind everybody it’s not an exclusive process. We’re not bringing in women or African-Americans or Hispanics in exclusion to other people. We’re actually just trying to bring them in and be a part of the whole environment.”\n",

      "Related: Watch out Intel and Samsung: TSMC is gearing up for 7nm processing with trial production\n",

In the last year, the executive pointed out that 43.3 percent of its new hires were either women or minorities, and the company is planning on releasing a diversity report that will include employee pay reflecting gender and race.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are going with the data and we are going public,” Krzanich said. “I almost hope there are gaps, not because I want people to be underpaid, but because it’s a problem I can fix. I’m an engineer, I like fixing problems.” Now, if only we could get all of Intel (and the tech industry) to help fix the problem, too.\n",

      "Paul Ryan’s Definitely-Not-Presidential Middle East Trip\n",
      "As Republicans back home whip up whispers, rumors, and entreaties for House Speaker Paul Ryan to swoop into the 2016 presidential race and save the GOP from tearing itself apart at an increasingly-likely contested convention, the Wisconsin congressman is on his first trip abroad as his party’s highest-elected official. With an itinerary of Middle East stops in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, such a trip seems somewhat, well … presidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "With dimming chances for significant legislative achievements this year and a battle for the top of the Republican ticket looming ever larger, Ryan has been increasingly pushed to weigh in. On Tuesday, Ryan’s home state delivered a huge boost to the presidential prospects of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is increasingly seen by GOP leaders as the most viable alternative to Donald Trump’s candidacy. Cruz won Wisconsin’s primary election by double-digits, 48 percent to Trump’s 35 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan says his role is neither rescuer nor referee. Yet he’s using his first trip abroad to draw an explicit contrast with President Barack Obama’s “neglectful” foreign policy, particularly toward Middle East partners such as Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing has changed — he’s not running for president, he’s not seeking the nomination,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres told Foreign Policy on Wednesday. “Speaker Ryan is focused on restoring traditional alliances that have been neglected under this administration and putting forward a vision of what U.S. foreign policy should look like in the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Israel is a popular stop for politicians of both parties, Ryan’s choosing it for his first is an intentional dig at Obama, who has had an at times icy relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent interview with the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama expressed frustration with Netanyahu, as well as Mideast Arab partners such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Obama administration officials and anonymous Israeli officials recently traded barbs in the press about who-snubbed-whom over a White House meeting with Netanyahu. Shortly after, at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee meeting in Washington last month, Ryan announced the Middle East trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have international terrorism that is threatening the civilized world. It’s threatening us. They’re coming at Israel, but they’re ultimately coming for us,” Ryan said Monday in an interview with the Times of Israel. “So we are partners in this war on terror, radical Islamic terrorism. Israel is an indispensable ally in that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost seven years after Obama’s famed Cairo speech, Ryan also spoke of developing “a generational strategy about winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world.” He reiterated oft-repeated criticism that the Obama administration doesn’t have a strategy to defeat the Islamic State, “let alone how do we prevent the 5-year-old in Pakistan from becoming a radical.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, his call for “a coalition of governments in moderate nations” to not only defeat the Islamic State but prevent radicalization is largely indistinguishable from Obama’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "While intended to serve as a rebuke to Obama, Ryan’s trip and tone also inevitably contrast the House speaker with Trump, the still-Republican front-runner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan has criticized Trump for his rhetoric and expressed some frustration with the billionaire businessman working crosswise against the mainstream Republican agenda. “We have to be more than just an opposition party. We have to be a proposition party,” Ryan has said consistently. But he’s also said he’ll support Trump if he’s chosen as the nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Trump’s own AIPAC speech drew applause, the pro-Israel lobby’s leaders formally admonished his criticism of Obama. Trump’s sizable loss in Wisconsin follows several weeks of controversy, including widely criticized statements on other candidates’ wives and abortion as well as a demonstrated lack of substance on foreign policy, and concerted efforts from the “Never Trump” campaign of anti-Trump Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliot Cohen, a prominent GOP national security expert and former State and Defense Department official, said he’d “be delighted” if Ryan would throw his name in the race if Trump or another candidate isn’t able to reach the required 1,237 candidates before the July GOP convention in Cleveland. Cohen is one of the main architects of a letter in which more than 50 Republican foreign policy experts expressed their concerns about Trump as a commander in chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This guy is just completely unacceptable,” Cohen said of Trump in a recent interview. “Cruz’s predisposition seems to be more narrowly nationalistic, whereas [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio was more ideology. … Paul Ryan is really right in the middle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who dropped out of the GOP presidential primary in December, said Ryan “isn’t a viable option.” Graham is so adamantly opposed to a potential Trump nomination that he’s endorsed Cruz, whom he openly acknowledges is a last choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take Paul at his word: I don’t think that’ll work,” Graham told reporters Tuesday. “Paul’s a great guy, a great speaker, a great candidate for president — I just don’t see how you can bring somebody in who wasn’t in the original group who went through the process and expect anything other than a disaster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, Ryan will be front and center at the convention — at the least, presiding over it as its chairman.\n",

      "In the Scholastic United States versions, the chapter illustrations and covers were illustrated by Caldecott honoree Mary Grandpré. All are amazingly detailed and lively. Yet, on closer inspection it becomes clear that Grandpré, like author J.K. Rowling, had a progression in mind for the Harry Potter series. As this infographic shows, the illustrations become darker as Harry grows older, which makes sense considering the increasing darkness Harry must wade through as his story progresses.

      "I Couldn't Handle Being a Disposable Stepmom, And It Cost Me My Relationship With My Stepdaughter\n",
      "I never wanted kids. They always struck me as tiny little bombs with perpetually runny noses and mysteriously sticky hands. I couldn't imagine loving a child of my own, never mind someone else's. My aversion to parenthood is the very reason I entered into a relationship with a young father so fearlessly. I was in my early twenties, had three serious relationships under my belt, and thought I knew everything there was to know about love.Spoiler alert — I knew nothing.I had fallen for him before I met his daughter, and managed to convince myself that sudden parenthood was not going to be a deal-breaker. I was blindly confident that everything would just work out and that his daughter's existence couldn't possibly alter my feelings. It was all going fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I met Gwen.I remember hiding in the house when she was dropped off, terrified and desperate to get out of there. Before I knew it, her father had made his way upstairs with her and was laying down next to me with Gwen on his chest. The little girl before me had a serious case of bed-head and was quietly sucking away on her pacifier. She wasn't quite the toddler-tornado for which I'd been bracing myself. After peering curiously at me for what seemed like an eternity, her big brown eyes locked on mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled. I felt my stomach drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment, I unwittingly gave away a piece of my heart that I would never get back; I'd never want it back. She was just shy of two years old the day I became her \"Teph,\" and was rapidly approaching five when we parted ways. In those short, perfectly imperfect years of tantrums, potty training, and gibberish, she would teach me more about love than any man ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't regret a second of the time we spent together, but I wish someone had warned me how hard it was all going to be.Being a stepparent is not for the faint of heart. Even those who start out with the best of intentions will eventually become Public Enemy #1. You can try to remain impartial, but sooner or later you will find yourself sucked into a vortex of legalese, petty arguments, and losing battles. If you're not careful, it can turn you into a power-hungry, bitter person who looks at love as though it is a competition. The worst part of all of this is that it's not just you who suffers. In trying to make everything better, you'll inadvertently make it all worse by hurting an innocent child.In my case, things started out rocky. Her mom and dad were still getting their footing as parents and there were growing pains compounded by my presence. Her mother and I met, spoke a few times to clear the air, and even attempted a friendship before it all degraded.Suddenly, every day of the week was a battle between father and mother. I felt impotent, useless, and beaten down by the constant reminder that nothing I wanted would ever truly matter. I was displaced — my heart told me that I was part of a family, and yet the fact remained that I'd always be on the outside. It wasn't my name on emergency contact forms. I had no right to pick her up from preschool or to even spend time with her alone. The title of \"dad's girlfriend\" was weightless and it was unbearable.My need to feel important drove me to involve myself. I desperately clawed my way into every argument he had with her until finally, it became mother versus stepmother. After a while, I couldn't take the pressure and anxiety. I possessed all the feelings, stress, worry, and love of a mother with none of the rights. I simply couldn't tolerate that I was expendable, and in the end, my fear became a self-fulfilling prophecy. In trying to find my place in the puzzle, all I did was destroy the picture. Before I knew it, he found a new piece to fit in my place.I remember the moment I realized I'd never see her again. I was still reeling from the breakup and prone to spontaneous bouts of sobbing. I would cry the hardest in my shower, because it was the one place that no one could hear me. After standing there for upwards of forty five minutes trying to understand why I felt more broken than I ever had after a failed relationship, it finally struck me — I lost two people, not just one. I could funnel my feelings towards her father into anger at him, but what was I to do with my heartbreak over her?I walked through life in a daze for months afterward. I had thought being a stepmom was isolating, but quickly discovered that it's even more devastatingly lonely to love a child you'll never see again. One moment I was a stranger, then suddenly I was a stepmom, and before I knew it I was an estranged stepmom. I was supposed to move on with my life as though I had never known what it is like to love a child as your own. I was expected to accept that there would just always be a hole in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact that we live in an age with a high divorce rate and kids commonly born out of wedlock, there is no easily accessible support for young stepparents. You'll find even less geared towards former stepparents. I searched everywhere from legal forums to books to Facebook groups, but there were no blogs or social circles for me to lean on. My friends were all in their early twenties and couldn't relate. At that stage in life, most of them considered the idea of an unwanted pregnancy to be far more of a travesty than losing a child that was never mine to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I held it in. I would write unsent letters to her from time to time, or make blog posts venting about my grief. Some days I would be fine, but then I'd hear a song, or visit a place we had gone together. Sometimes it would be a photo that would break me. I'd trip over my own memories and find myself spiraling down the rabbit hole that existed in my heart. Most holidays were tough. Her birthday was worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never got to say goodbye to her. After a while, I convinced myself that she had forgotten about me.I was wrong.Two years after the last time I saw Gwen, her mother contacted me to say that her daughter had been talking about me, and we struck up a long, heartfelt conversation. It was the type of talk I wish we'd been able to have years prior; one free of anger, jealousy, and immaturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "One year later, Gwen and I picked up right where we left off. She was taller, her face and arms had thinned out, but she still had the same tiny voice and wide smile when she launched herself into my arms again for the first time in three years. Her mom has since become one of my closest friends and they are now both a part of my family. We catch up regularly and take vacations together. Both mother and daughter were in my wedding party. I haven't missed any more of her birthdays, and ensure I'm there for all the other big life moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that my story is an anomaly. Happy endings for former stepparents are rare. Most simply break ties with their partners and never again see the children they once considered family.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a hole in your heart like I did, I want to tell you what I needed to hear back then: It's okay to hurt, cry, scream, rant, and fall apart. It's okay to miss them. It's okay to speak their names. Most importantly, it's okay to tell someone that you were once a stepparent and now you're not.\n",

      "A new study finds a correlation between the aerial spraying of pesticides to kill mosquitoes and an increased risk of developmental delays and autism among kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the new findings, presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2016 meeting, researchers looked at the rates of autism and developmental delays from eight zip codes in a region of New York that is exposed to yearly airplane pesticide spraying to prevent mosquito-borne disease like eastern equine encephalitis virus. They compared those to the rates in 16 zip codes where the pesticide spraying doesn’t happen. (Other forms of pesticide spraying could still occur, like manual spreading.) They controlled for factors like poverty and gender variation across the zip codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors report that kids living in zip codes where the spraying was done each summer had around a 25% higher risk of an autism diagnosis or developmental problem compared to kids living in areas without the aerial spraying. “Several studies have previously reported links between pesticide and autism risk,” says Dr. Steve Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine in an email to TIME. “Our data suggests the way in which pesticides are applied might play some role. Studies of pesticides in animal models show they can affect certain neurotransmitters in the brain, but their exact molecular effects on brain development are still being explored.”\n",

      "The study only shows a correlation between the two and does not show that aerial pesticide spraying causes autism. It also does not provide information about whether a child could have been exposed during pregnancy or after birth. Aerial spraying is a common mosquito control tool, and states in the U.S. are ramping up efforts to control mosquito populations amid the ongoing Zika outbreak. The study authors state that the findings are not strong enough to change mosquito control practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cities and states should not stop spraying based on this data alone,” says Hicks. “This study needs to be replicated in other regions of the country that use similar spraying methods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the meantime,” he adds, “communities should continue to warn residents to stay indoors, cover gardens and cover children’s play equipment during periods of spraying, which most already do. It would be important to know what percentage of residents are actually receiving and following these recommendations from their local department of health.”\n",

      "\n",
      "We’d all like to think our hairstylist is a magical genie who is perfectly capable of granting any sort of hair wish. But truthfully speaking, our go-to stylists are only human, and can’t transform your tresses with the flick of a magic wand. And yes, you may think you know the ins and outs of everything hair, but maintaining appropriate salon etiquette is key to ensuring a great appointment for both you and your stylist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is seeing eye to eye crucial, but it can also help you achieve those wondrous (and not to mention realistic) results every time you pop into the salon. So, if you are looking to brush up your salon etiquette, here’s five things you can stop saying altogether. Yes, that even includes asking for discounts.\n",

      "There’s probably nothing a colorist hates more than lying about previous dye jobs you may have had in the past. Whether you’ve done henna, a semi-permanent color or highlights, Shaun Surething, co-owner and lead stylist at New York–based Seagull Hair Salon, says there is definitely still existing color in your hair, making it extra important to be honest about your past color history.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lying about having no traces of color in your hair will result in unpredictable results in the salon,” says Surething. “Even the most well-trained colorists can sometimes not see an old gloss that will affect the outcome of your new color.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Even worse comes lying about using box color, which can really affect your color outcome, especially if you plan on going lighter. To avoid unwanted and awkward color overlap, be sure to tell your stylist about any box color products you may have used in the past, even if it was three years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't ever try to lie about using box dye or at-home color in hopes we won't find out when you want to go lighter,” says Tiffany Chiapparelli, lead educator for amika. “We are lifting your hair from any color you've had, so there is no point in lying about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Don’t Hold Back Either\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaints at the salon can be tricky, but there usually is a way to air your grievances without sounding like that nagging woman everyone dreads. Experts like Chiapparelli stress the importance of speaking up, especially if your results are not to your satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't be shy if there is an issue that you notice mid-appointment,” she says. “We want you to be happy—so please speak up!”\n",

      "Don’t Think Your Results Are Going to Look Like the Picture\n",
      "\n",
      "Visuals can be more than helpful when it comes to showing your stylist exactly what you are going for, but some experts warn against relying on celebrity hair photos, as they can create unrealistic expectations. Just because your favorite songstress went blond, doesn’t mean you’ll get the same dramatic bleached effect. \"If you bring in a photo of a hair color you want, keep in mind that photo might have been edited, and there may not be a way to create that color in real life,” states Jackie Ferrara, senior colorist at Pierre Michel Salon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the same concept also applies to haircuts, as different facial shapes and features can make any chop look different on anyone. “We all have different head shapes, face shapes, features, hair texture and even hair color,” says Nicole Contrastano, senior expert stylist from Pierre Michel Salon. “One haircut can take on a whole different look on someone else.”\n",

      "Don’t Show Up Late, and Demand to Be Out On Time\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to tick off your hairstylist is showing up late, which can seriously throw a wrench into his or her schedule. A stylist’s schedule can book fast throughout the day, and showing up extremely late can throw off his or her workflow, really affecting your results.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can't make miracles happen and rush to give you the best appointment when we don't have the allotted time,” adds Michelle Lee, co-owner and master designer of Salon Eva Michelle in Boston. “Stylists naturally want their clients to be happy with the service, but if we feel rushed and we can't make it the best, it's a double-edged sword.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t Be Resistant To Change\n",
      "\n",
      "Change is always synonymous with a new cut or color, so experts recommend keeping this in mind when booking appointments, especially for haircuts. According to stylist Amerah at Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa, clients should always remember that all haircuts require some sort of change, even if you are coming in for a trim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t say you want a haircut, but then proceed to say you don't want the hair to look shorter,”Amerah says. “Anytime you cut hair, it only gets shorter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Chiapperelli finds that you shouldn’t give your stylist mixed messages either, as backing out of changes you’ve agreed to makes the process more unnecessarily complicated than it should be. “Don't tell your hairstylist you are ready for a change and then decline every one of our suggestions—it sounds like what you really need is a margarita and a good therapy session,” she adds.\n",

      "“Our aviation readiness is really my number one concern,” General Robert Neller, commandant of the Marine Corps, told Congress in April. “We don’t have enough airplanes that we would call ‘ready basic aircraft.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States Marine Corps boasts 276 F/A-18 fighter jets in its inventory, but fewer than 100 of them are flight-worthy, according to the Marines. The reason? Blame an unfortunate serendipity of budget cuts, personnel losses, and 15 years of steady combat operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the planes that have been grounded have since been torn apart in order to fix other operating aircraft. The military budget cuts caused by sequestration have resulted in less money available for new parts, forcing maintenance crews to seek out unorthodox, even cannibalistic methods of finding replacement pieces when things break. In one case, Marines pulled a landing gear bay door off of a retired plane parked on the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier converted to a museum ship in 1975.\n",
      "\n",
      "Budget cuts have also contributed to the Marine Corps' downsizing over the last few years. Since 2010, more than 30,000 Marines have left without being replaced—many of them senior mechanics and skilled technicians who left the Corps for better-paying jobs in the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The planes have been in more or less constant combat rotation since shortly after 9/11, when the jets were called into battle over Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Between that conflict, the Iraq War, operations in Libya and the current fight against ISIS, the planes and choppers are feeling the strain of all those years of hard use.\n",

      "Update, 4/18/2016: A Minnesota toddler is the latest child to die after an IKEA MALM dresser tipped over. After his mom put Theodore \"Ted\" McGee down for a nap in his bedroom, she went back to check on her son 20 minutes later, and found the six-drawer chest had fallen on top of the 22-month-old. \"They didn't hear the dresser fall,\" the family's attorney Alan Feldman said. \"They didn't hear Ted scream.\"\n",

      "The McGees, who hadn't heard about the repair program last July, are pursuing a lawsuit against the retailer for not issuing a stronger warning. Both the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and IKEA are investigating the death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original Story, 7/22/2015: IKEA may be known for their easy-to-assemble furniture and endless home decor options, but the Sweden-based company is currently gaining attention for a slightly less appealing reason. Apparently, there are potential dangers associated with their classic MALM collection and other pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conjunction with the CPSC, the retailer just announced that they are recalling 27 million chests and dressers because they can tip over and crush children if they aren't properly anchored to the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news comes after two children died after furniture fell on them in 2014, though the company says it has been made aware of 14 other reports of tip-over incidents that led to four injuries and three additional deaths from tip-overs since 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, IKEA's U.S. commercial manager Patty Lobell said they are \"deeply saddened\" by the deaths and hope \"our efforts prevent further tragedies.\" Beyond the recall, those efforts include a new repair program in which consumers who have purchased any of the 7 million MALM chests and 20 million other IKEA chests included, can order or pick up a new free wall anchoring kit instead of returning the furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "But CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye doesn't want IKEA to stop there, as he hopes the company will lead the way by setting an example for the entire furniture industry to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today is a positive step and I commend IKEA for taking that step,\" said Kaye. \"But they need to do more and to make more stable furniture and they need to help lead industry.\"\n",

      "3 Ways to Be Smarter About Drawing Retirement Income From Your Nest Egg\n",
      "A new survey from New York Life shows that retirees and pre-retirees are more savvy about spending down their savings than they were a decade ago, with more than twice as many today saying that annual withdrawals should be held to less than 5% of one’s nest egg to avoid prematurely depleting it. But despite the improvement, far too many people still don’t have a clue about the right way to draw down their savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "When New York Life asked retirees and pre-retirees in their 40s or older back in 2006 how much they could withdraw from their nest egg each year if they wanted it to last a lifetime, only 10% correctly answered that they should limit their withdrawal rate to less than 5%. Flash forward 10 years. When the same insurer put the same question to the same age group today, more than twice as many—23%—gave the correct answer. Progress? Sure, except that still leaves 77% who either overestimated how much they could withdraw or simply didn’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a way, this isn’t surprising. After all, estimating a sustainable level of withdrawals can be a challenge. Even the one withdrawal standard that’s gained some popular recognition—the 4% rule—has come under heightened scrutiny lately, with many retirement experts saying that it may be too high given today’s low yields and anemic projected returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the large number of factors that come into play—investment performance, your asset allocation, how long you might live, etc.—no withdrawal rate or system for spending down your nest egg can guarantee success. But it is possible to develop an approach that can improve your odds of tapping your savings for the income you need without incurring too high a risk of outliving your dough. Here are three tips that can help you do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Think beyond a “safe” withdrawal rate. When it comes to spending down their nest egg, most people concentrate on how much they can safely withdraw from their nest egg without running through their savings too soon. Which is understandable. No one wants to spend their dotage with little or no money left in their retirement accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this emphasis on not outliving one’s savings can have a significant downside. Being overly cautious about withdrawals could force you to dramatically downsize your lifestyle. And if the financial markets perform well over the course of your retirement, the value of your investments could surge, leaving you with a big pile of savings late in life. That might not seem like much of a concern, except that it could mean that you lived more frugally than was necessary during the early years of your retirement, when you could have spent more on travel, entertainment or just living larger and enjoying life more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So rather than trying to identify a “safe” withdrawal rate, I recommend you focus instead on finding a reasonable withdrawal rate that gives you adequate assurance that your savings will last but doesn’t require you to unnecessarily scale back your standard of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasonable people can disagree on what such a reasonable withdrawal rate should be, but I’d say that somewhere around 3% to 4% of savings is generally a good starting point, assuming you want your nest egg to last at least 30 years. You can stick to the lower end of that range (or even dip below it) if you want greater assurance you won’t outlive your savings, although doing so would mean having to get by on less income. Conversely, if you’re not as worried about prematurely depleting your nest egg (or you have other resources you can fall back on if you do), then you may want to start at the upper end of that range (or even exceed it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Read More: How To Create Your Own Retirement Pension\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Be prepared to roll with the punches. Once you’ve settled on a withdrawal regimen, you need to stay flexible about tweaking it in response to changing market conditions. For example, if the stock market experiences a major setback, the combination of investment losses and the money you draw from savings withdrawals could so deplete your nest egg that you may run through it much more quickly. So in such a case, you may want to scale back withdrawals for a year or so to give your portfolio a chance to recover. Conversely, if the market goes on a tear and the value of your nest egg soars, you may want to take the opportunity to indulge yourself and boost withdrawals a bit to avoid ending up with a huge stash of cash late in life when you may not be able to enjoy it as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine whether you should trim or boost the amount you pull from savings, plug information such as your nest egg’s current value and your planned level of withdrawals into a retirement income calculator that estimates the chances your savings will be able to support you for life. If the outlook has deteriorated since the last time you did this assessment, then you may want to pare withdrawals a bit. If the chances have increased, then you might consider upping your withdrawal. The point, though, is that by making small adjustments every year or so, you’ll be less likely to end up with too little (or too much) money late in retirement when your options are more limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider locking in additional guaranteed income. If you’re confident that you can manage withdrawals so that you can cover retirement expenses while simultaneously ensuring you won’t run out of money before you run out of time, great. You can stop at tips 1 and 2 above. But if you like the idea of having more pension-like income than Social Security alone will provide—whether for financial reasons or because assured income can boost retirement happiness—then you may want to consider devoting a portion of your savings to an immediate annuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT\n",
      "\n",
      "With an immediate annuity, you invest a lump sum with an insurance company in exchange for monthly payments that start immediately and continue to roll in the rest of your life regardless of how the financial markets perform. For example, a 65-year-old man who invests $100,000 in an immediate annuity today might receive roughly $550 a month; a 65-year-old couple (man and woman) would collect about $460 a month as long as either one is alive. To see how much you might receive for different investment amounts and ages, you can go to this annuity calculator.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you think adding an immediate annuity to your retirement income plan might make sense, make sure you understand an annuity’s drawbacks as well as its advantages. And should you still decide to go ahead, you’ll also want to shop around for quotes from several insurers with high financial strength ratings and, as a further precaution, keep the amount you invest with any single insurer with the coverage limits of your state’s insurance guaranty association.\n",

      "We humans have a knack for complicating the simplest of ideas. Our lives are filled with shortcuts that aren’t short, tips and tricks that trip us up, and helpful hints that are anything but. The same is true when it comes to frugality. Let’s scrap all the circular talk and bottom-line it. Here are the only six rules of frugal living you need to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Know Your Money\n",
      "\n",
      "By whatever means necessary, become ridiculously well-acquainted with how much you earn, how much you spend, and where every dollar goes. It’s the foundation of frugal living. Without this baseline knowledge, successful budgeting and saving will always be out of reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Live Below Your Means\n",
      "\n",
      "Living within your means is a great start, but living below your means is where the real magic happens. The surplus it generates is the capital for saving and investing and the fuel behind long-term wealth building. If you’re unable to run a surplus a majority of the time — either by cutting expenses or growing your income — you’ll never get ahead of the game.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Know the Difference Between Spending and Investing\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending and investing might feel like the same thing, but they’re completely different animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investing is the outlay of cash in exchange for a tangible asset (think job training, a primary residence, or shares in a mutual fund). Spending, on the other hand, is the outlay of cash for something that will likely depreciate in value and not provide any long-term benefit (think dinners out or a new summer wardrobe).\n",
      "\n",
      "Being frugal doesn’t mean you always have choose investing over spending (after all, spending is part of living), but it does require that you understand the difference and know how to put your income to work a majority of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Buy for Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Frugality isn’t about always buying the cheapest product; it’s about diligently seeking out the best value. Sometimes that means choosing quality over price. A pair of shoes that cost $20 might seem like a great deal, but they’re not if you have to replace them every three months. A $75 pair that will last two or three years will be a far better value in the long run.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Avoid Consumer Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Frugal folks know it: Interest on consumer debt is a tax people pay for living beyond their means. And while a credit card can save the day from time-to-time, embracing easy credit as a way to pad your lifestyle can have disastrous consequences. Interest and other charges will bleed your budget and choke your chances at real financial security.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Know the Difference Between a Want and a Need\n",
      "\n",
      "As I write this, there are throngs of advertisers plotting new ways to help consumers confuse wants and needs. It’s big business. In reality, our needs are fairly straightforward (nourishing food, secure shelter, good healthcare, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about that self-cleaning, solar-powered, lavender-infused kitty litter box that you can control with your smartphone? What sort of primitive existence would you be reduced to without this life-changing gadget?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s face it: Being able to distinguish what we want from what we need is a prerequisite for making wise buying decisions. If you can’t master this skill, your needs will be endless and your paycheck will never keep up. (See also: 25 Products You Think You Need, But Really Don’t)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the curious thing: Today, when we talk about the rules of frugal living, aren’t we really talking about basic financial literacy? It seems over the past couple of generations, common fiscal sense has been reframed as an extreme lifestyle. Maybe it’s time to change the conversation about saving and managing money — and make frugal living a far more fundamental skill.\n",

      "Even deep Tesla skeptics call this demand unprecedented. There simply may be no example of a new car attracting as much interest in more than a century of automative history. Veteran auto analyst Bertel Schmidt says the closest comparison would be the 1955 Citroen DS (below), which was pre-ordered by 12,000 motorists on launch day. Wall Street has responded by sending Tesla’s share price up by about 12% since the Model 3’s debut.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s natural to ask whether we are observing an iPhone moment, the release of a blockbuster product that reconfigures the commercial landscape and transforms society. And, if we are, whether Tesla’s rivals face possible Nokiafication–a savage commercial blow in the face of a missed technological advance. (With a blog post yesterday titled, “The Week that Electric Vehicles Went Mainstream,” Tesla seems to suggest the answer at least to the first question is yes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If traditional automakers fear obsolescence, they aren’t showing it. ”While we applaud and welcome any new competitors to market, BMW remains focused on delivering the most innovative, efficient and technologically advanced vehicles to our customers,” BMW spokeswoman Rebecca Kiehne told Quartz.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll react to the competition,” says Tim Grewe, General Motors’ lead manager for electrification. “But our master plan hasn’t changed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such resolve, typical of people you talk to at the major car companies these days, is perhaps a sign of strength, a byproduct of confidence in the new electrics now in the pipeline, and ultimately skepticism that Musk will get much beyond the fringes of the worldwide automotive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or it could be a sign of complacency, a Nokia-like assumption that the moat is simply too wide for any new rival to traverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I definitely think that the auto industry has been surprised by the success of the [Model 3] pre-orders,” says Sam Jaffe, an analyst with Cairn Energy Research. “But I doubt that they will do anything in reaction to it. The whole concept of pre-ordering is so foreign to the car industry that they will probably willfully ignore it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But if there is one area in which Musk is objectively behind, it’s the speed with which mid-priced electrics will come to market. GM’s Chevy Bolt, for example—also priced at about $35,000, with a range exceeding 200 miles on a charge—will be in showrooms by the end of this year, the company says; Tesla customers won’t get their hands on a Model 3 until the end of 2017 at the earliest, and possibly not until 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grewe says that GM’s plant in Orion, Michigan is “ready to go now. We have no hurdles. We are ready for high-volume production. You can go buy the Bolt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Left unsaid but implied was that Musk is not quite so prepared. The question is whether he can catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is plenty of room for Musk to fall flat on his face\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Posawatz, who was part of the GM management team that developed the company’s plug-in hybrid Volt, argues that the onus of Tesla’s thick order book is not on its major rivals, but on Tesla itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Posawatz, now a private consultant, points out that Musk has been late—seriously late—delivering all three current Tesla models. When he finally delivered the Model X crossover in September 2015, it was three and a half years after the promised date.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, some Teslas produced to date have had quality issues. In October, Consumer Reports removed the Model S from its recommended list because of complaints including “squeaks, rattles and leaks,” not to mention problematic motors and brakes. Tesla largely repaired these flaws for free, and the company’s image hasn’t noticeably suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla That’s one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk’s challenge with the Model 3 isn’t just that he has ground to make up in terms of reliability, but that he again is starting from scratch: The Model 3 is derivative of no prior model; Musk must create entirely new assembly lines for the car in Tesla’s Fremont, California, factory (pictured above). The Model 3 battery, too, will be new. The place where it will be made–Musk’s vaunted Gigafactory, the gigantic lithium-ion battery plant he is building outside Reno, Nevada–“has yet to make a single cell,” Posawatz says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it’s not as though Tesla’s rivals are standing still. In addition to GM’s Chevy Bolt, Nissan will produce a second-generation Leaf with the same 200-mile range and approximately $35,000 price; it will come in 2017. Before that, Toyota will deliver its Prius Prime, a plug-in hybrid; and BMW already has its pure electric i3. The other major carmakers are piling in as well by the end of the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hoopla in response to these vehicles may never approach that generated by the Model 3. But every time another electric shows up on the scene, Musk risks losing customers to the incumbents—and has less wiggle room to miss his own delivery deadlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is the kind of trouble that you want\n",
      "\n",
      "Musk has his challenge laid out for him—really tough, no question about it. But, if you’re in the car business, or any business really, this is the sort of problem that you want, versus one of lackluster demand, which is what has plagued rivals since electrics came onto the market six years ago. In terms of whether Musk is up to it, remember, this is the man who over the last decade has single-handedly validated both electric cars and private commercial space travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "AP/Ringo H.W. Chiu A problem all of us should have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing experts might argue—with good reason—that making 325,000 identically reliable, $35,000 automobiles on deadline is harder than putting a commercial rocket into space and bringing it home. But it is not as though Musk has spent the last decade in an ivory tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you forget about 2017—which arguably was never a realistic deadline—and instead look to 2019, Musk has three years to make good on the Model 3’s promise. If he delivers, both literally and figuratively, then he will create the transformational moment he has sought, both for Tesla and the industry as a whole. In other words, he does have a chance to catch up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Musk has already said that he is recontemplating his production plans. To fund the necessary manufacturing buildout, he is also probably talking with advisers about raising a lot of new capital. Barclays’ Brian Johnson reckons that Musk will sell $3 billion in new shares, and that seems a reasonable estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what we seem likely to be watching now is Tesla in a cool, cash-raising frenzy, and an incumbent industry on a risky precipice. In the middle of it all is Musk, aiming not necessarily for a Nokia moment for his rivals—though that could happen, he actually wants them to succeed—but most certainly aiming for an iPhone moment for himself.\n",

      "What Makes a Great Teacher\n",
      "The idea that the U.S. may be facing a potential teacher shortage, or that teachers are consistently undervalued, probably wouldn’t surprise anyone who follows today’s education news. And, as Teacher Appreciation Week begins on Monday, it’s worth remembering that the problem isn’t exactly new.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1960s, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare secretary John Gardner bemoaned the “flight from teaching” that was going on within academia. That comment inspired TIME to take a look at those people who were defying the trend, for a cover story in the May 6, 1966, issue—50 years ago this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n",
      "\n",
      "The story, which focused on great college professors, profiled 10 men who were exemplars of the profession, and found that great teaching was hard to do but easy to define:\n",
      "\n",
      "While teaching is a highly personal blend of style, scholarship and attitudes, the qualities of the great teachers of the past are not at all mysterious. Socrates, bearded and bald, gave his name to today’s best seminar style simply by plucking insights out of youthful minds with incisive questions. Aristotle drew upon the illustrative experiences of his reckless youth to inspire other youths to be good; his Lyceum linked research and teaching by analyzing biological specimens. In a medieval age of faith, the unconventional Peter Abelard employed shafts of wit and the theory that “constant questioning is the first key to wisdom” to draw throngs to his school of dialectics near Paris. …In a sense—computers, films, labs and TV notwithstanding—nothing much has come along in 2,400 years that essentially improves the Socratic pattern of a learned man plus a group of students, but the pattern can work out in sharply varied and instructive styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story, however, doesn’t fully apply to today’s problems. The teaching atmosphere the story addressed was in college only, where pay and prestige weren’t so much of a problem, and all of the teachers in question—in a fact that probably accurately reflected the Ivory Tower of the day—were white men. Another story later that year addressed the teacher shortage in public schools, where pay was low (“the basic problem is that teaching salaries in most public schools are not competitive with jobs in industry and government requiring lesser skills,” the story explained) and prestige was too. (The illustration accompanying that story, perhaps unsurprisingly, was of a woman. Today, the vast majority of schoolteachers are women.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But while the 1966 cover story didn’t fully capture every side of the decades-long problem getting great teachers into America’s classrooms, the takeaway still holds up: Great teachers, wherever they’re found, deserve to be acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "And sure enough, many TIME readers wrote in to make sure their favorite teachers got the recognition they deserved. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw your list of teachers, but I didn’t see my teacher’s name,” wrote Bobby McIntosh. “She is the best teacher I have ever had. Her name is Miss McAllister, Grade 3, Crystal Spring, Roanoke, Va.”\n",

      "What Does Obama Have to Gain from Going to Hiroshima?\n",
      "Once again, we discover that The Washington Post is covering a world with which the rest of us are unfamiliar, and that there are members of the current administration who are more than willing to set up housekeeping there. The Post reported on Saturday that the president is considering visiting Hiroshima, where he would deliver an address on nuclear non-proliferation. This seems like a fine place to deliver such an address, but what do I know? There are, of course, domestic political problems with the idea, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House is well aware of the potential for domestic criticism around a Hiroshima trip, especially in an election year. Republicans have consistently portrayed Obama's foreign policy as feckless and weak, and the president was ridiculed in 2009 when he bowed to the Japanese emperor in Tokyo. During the 2012 presidential campaign, GOP nominee Mitt Romney accused Obama of undertaking a global \"apology tour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, so here we see the problem—and it's not that the Post is treating what Republicans said as fact simply because Republicans said it. Per the Post's own link, the \"bowing\" episode bothered both Laura Bush's old flack and someone called Political Pistachio. And Mitt Romney is an unprincipled has-been. However, having taken this nonsense as seriously as it has, the Post then finds an administration official willing to say that the sky is a lovely shade of burnt sienna.\n",
      "\n",
      "White House aides say they are confident that Obama can pay respects to the victims of the war—on both sides of the Pacific—without provoking a major political backlash in the United States. The feeling within the White House is that a Hiroshima visit, while not crucial to the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance, would offer the president another opportunity to recognize history without being, in his words, \"imprisoned\" by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This person is a dolt. The president could repurpose the Enola Gay and fly it into Hiroshima personally, and the monkeyhouse would go absolutely mad. (A good indication of this is the fact that John Kerry's visit to the city over the weekend occasioned an uproar among the inmates of Bedlam.) Either the White House doesn't give a damn, which is how it should be, or somebody in there continues to believe in the Unicorn Of Understanding that the administration pursued for far too long. I hope he goes. I hope he gives the speech he apparently wants to give. But I have no illusions about what will happen in this country if he does.\n",

      "Why You Should Check Your Social Security Statement Today\n",
      "I’m not a fan of made-up commemorative days , but I’m making an exception for Social Security’s National Check Your Statement Day on April 7. Understanding your statement is crucial to your retirement security, so it's well worth a calendar call-out. I'll walk you through the key points to look for and explain how this information plays into your Social Security claiming choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, get a copy of Your Social Security Statement (yes, that's the official name). You may recall receiving a printed statement in the mail annually. As a part of a budget-cutting plan, the agency ended these mailings several years ago and instead put the information online, where few people saw it. After prolonged complaints, Social Security now sends paper statements on a modified schedule to older Americans, but everyone else has to set up an online account.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't have a recent Social Security statement, go to the “ My Social Security ” website and sign up—it's easy to do. You'll see a four-page document containing your wage history and benefit projections. Here's a rundown of the key sections in the statement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sign up for RETIRE WITH MONEY and more. View Sample Sign Up\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Earnings Record. Go to page three of the statement to see the official record of your taxed Social Security earnings, which is the portion of your income that's subject to payroll taxes. There are separate columns for Social Security and Medicare earnings, which have different tax ceilings. (For Social Security, the ceiling is $118,500 this year, and for Medicare, there's no ceiling.) The agency uses W-2 tax forms for this information. Make sure Social Security's earnings record agrees with your own records. If it does not, or you have other earnings questions, call the agency at 1-800-772-1213.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Estimated Benefits . In this section, found on page two, you will see a series of important benefit projections. This is what the different estimates tell you:\n",
      "\n",
      "*Retirement. These are the retirement benefits you would receive at different claiming ages, based on your current earnings history. Social Security retirement benefits normally may be claimed as early as age 62, but if you defer filing, the amount rises by 7% to 8% a year. Your benefit amount maxes out at age 70. If you claim your retirement benefits before what’s called full retirement age (FRA)—now 66—you will be hit with early claiming reductions . If you’re still working, you may also face temporary benefit cuts caused by Social Security’s earnings test .\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disability. If you are younger than full retirement age, you'll be told you could qualify for Social Security disability payments and, should you become disabled, you'll see an estimated benefit amount. Those payments automatically convert to regular retirement benefits at FRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read next: How I Lowered the Taxes on My Retirement Income\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*Family. When you retire, or if you become disabled, your earnings record may also entitle your spouse and children to benefits, but Social Security does not provide estimates of these payments. That's a major flaw in these statements, because overlooking spousal and child benefits is a key reason so many people make bad claiming decisions . Your spouse and school-aged children can claim benefits roughly equal to as much as half of your actual or projected retirement benefit as of your own FRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people fail to claim these benefits. Or they claim them too early, which will trigger reductions in those benefits and perhaps in your spouse's individual retirement benefits. These payments are also subject to complicated family maximum benefit rules that limit in the overall amount you and your family members can claim based on your Social Security earnings record.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Survivors. When you die, your surviving spouse (or divorced spouse) and your school-age children may receive benefits based on your earnings record. Social Security does project those benefits here and also lists the limit on payments under the family maximum benefit rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people fail to claim survivor benefits or understand the often complex claiming rules that govern them. These benefits are not only tied to your earnings record but may also be affected by the timing of your individual retirement benefit claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculator: [time-calcxml id=ret06]\n",
      "\n",
      "Your spouse’s benefits, for example, will equal the greater of her or his own retirement benefit or survivor benefit based on your earnings record. If you wait to file for your own retirement benefits until age 70, you will receive the maximum amount—plus you may also be providing your spouse the maximum survivor benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish these earnings statements provided more explanation of Social Security’s complicated claiming rules. But they do at least give you essential earnings information and claims projections that you can use to ask more questions and develop a claiming strategy that will benefit both you and family members who depend on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "So use the statement as a springboard for developing a full financial plan. And it's best to get started now, even if your retirement date is decades away. You don't want to wait until it's too late to protect your family.\n",

As viewers might recall, Lannister was submitted to a penance walk that required her to strip down naked, get her hair shaven off and walk through the slums of town as disgusted onlookers shouted slurs and threw rubbish at her. Plus, a nun-looking Silent Sister followed her about town robotically ringing a handbell and saying, \"Shame!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "It was not Cersei's best moment, and according to an interview with Entertainment Weekly, it wasn't one of Headey's either. The actress had received a lot of flak for opting out of filming the scene nude and using a body double instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some people thought I was less of an actress because I didn't get my tits out,\" she said, revealing that numerous factors like the intense vulnerability of the scene, how she would have reacted while filming and having children all weighed in on her decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told EW:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know what? It was really a bit shocking. I've done nudity. I'm not adverse to it. But I know I'm a very emotional actor and I get really driven by that. In order to do my job, I allow myself to be really vulnerable. I don't know any other way to do my job. Things really affect me. And the thought of being naked for three days and trying to contain her in the way she would be I think I would feel very angry. I didn't want to be angry. I don't think Cersei would be angry. I did what I thought she would do, emotionally. And wonderful Rebecca [Van Cleave, Headey's stand-in] was able to contain herself and be naked. She found it very difficult, obviously. It's not a natural thing to do. I film every year and I have kids and they know me now and [being naked in the scene] was just too much on top of that. So yeah, people that get it thought it was great. I didn't phone it in; I was actually there for three days with Rebecca.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She also dropped some hints about Cersei in the upcoming episodes. According to Headey, this is the Lannister matriarch's \"most interesting season\" since she finds herself in such a low place. Her relationship with Jaime is also \"at an all-time weird level,\" Headey says.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the season as a whole, she calls it \"juicy,\" \"f*cking dark\" and \"emotionally clever.\" Guess we'll find out what that means in six days.\n",

      "Southwest of Salem: The Story of the San Antonio Four/ Facebook\n",
      "\n",
      "When we started watching Making A Murderer, we likely didn’t have an idea on how (seemingly) corrupt Steven Avery’s case would be. With each episode, we became more and more angry over the fact that Avery was, without a doubt, not given a fair trial. Obviously based on the success of the show, information about the case spread much farther than Manitowoc County. Compelling cases like this make us all want to speak out, and share our opinions on how such an investigation could go so horribly wrong. Southwest of Salem: the Story of the San Antonio Four, is hoping for the same impact. Premiering at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, this documentary is already being heavily discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves four women, Elizabeth Ramirez, Anna Vasquez, Kristie Mayhugh, and Cassandra Rivera, who were put in jail after two of Ramirez’s nieces claimed that all four women sexually abused them and forced to be included in satanic rituals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to Steven Avery, after hearing such an incredible claim (from children, no less) you’d automatically pen these women as monsters. But again, just like Avery, there’s more to the story that can prove that these four women were unfairly incarcerated due to a corrupt trial.\n",

      "So, why was this trial corrupt? Well, the courts decided to focus on one thing — the sexual orientation of these ladies. Court documents are riddled with terms like “homosexual,” “lesbian,” and “gay,” and the courts seemed to focus more on that than anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "All four of them were shocked by the initial accusations, finding them to be a little bizarre — but since they were going up against the word of children, they had an even harder time proving their innocence. Similarly to Making A Murderer, this documentary took a long time to piece together, and filmmaker Deborah S. Esquenazi worked alongside the Innocence Project of Texas to try and give these women a chance to tell their side of the story in a non-bias way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film is expected to hit theaters shortly, and we can’t wait to see how everything plays out. While child abuse is definitely a serious claim that should never be taken lightly, these women should be able to have a second chance to prove their innocence if they’re truly innocent of this terrible crime.\n",

But, at least for the four putative liberals on the Court, it must have been awfully tempting to look down at the plaintiff's table and, hearing counsel arguing against the president's legal right to issue executive orders on immigration, ask:\n",

      "\n",
      "The case argued on Monday, United States v. Texas, is a direct confrontation between the states and the president's conception of executive power in the area of immigration law. In brief, Texas claims that the president's 2014 decision to use an executive order to defer action on undocumented immigrants will cost the state of Texas because of a whole host of new obligations—from driver's licenses to the price of public education. (The president's actions allowed about four million undocumented immigrants a chance to breathe a little easier.) The president's position is that Texas doesn't have the right to bring this action at all. The energy under the case, of course, is the constant and undying idea that this particular president doesn't have the right to act like a president in ways that his political opponents find unseemly. (The gracious souls of the U.S. House Of Representatives got 18 minutes to argue against the administration before the Court.) Between this, and the Zubik case that was argued last month, we may be seeing the last cases brought under the unique legal theory that, in 2009, Barack Obama did not acquire the full powers of the presidency the way his more conventional—and whiter—predecessors did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question is does Texas have the right to bring this case,\" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"Texas says if you give legal status to these people, then we'll have to give them drivers licenses. The federal government says there's nothing in this law about drivers licenses. This law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves, it does not impose any obligations on the states. So the states should not have the right to challenge it. That's the standing argument. I think the Obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case, whether it is lawful.\"\n",

      "There might have been an interesting—and significant—question of constitutional law to be argued in this case, assuming that the case had been brought with an ounce of good faith whatsoever. But, in the context of the stated desire of the Republicans in Congress to use all means, fair or foul, to hamstring the presidency of any Democrat elected to the office, and especially this one, then that question gets subsumed in the context of the ongoing political vandalism that passes for political philosophy. The reports from the oral arguments on Monday seem to indicate that the Court is split along the now-customary 4-4 lines, although more than one observer has noted that the standing issue might be a lifeboat in which the Court could escape from a 4-4 ruling on executive powers, which would be a mess. In addition, and even though we know that electoral politics never plays a role in the Court's decisions, it might just rule against Texas on the standing issue because the justices know that whoever gets elected in November can rescind this president's actions the moment he or she is sworn in. Never underestimate the power of the passed buck, especially among those people with lifetime tenure.\n",

      "When American Slaves Fought Back — Alongside the British\n",
      "They teach history all wrong. Dates are important, sure, but the reality of it is, no one remembers the dates without the deeds, and when the deeds include 400 slaves becoming British soldiers and duking it out with Andrew Jackson in Florida? Well, you start to wonder why it’s not already a Tarantino flick.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1814, British Rear Adm. Sir Alexander Cochrane, skirmishing with the United States on the Atlantic and along the Gulf of Mexico as part of the War of 1812, had an idea. Not a particularly novel one, as it followed a similar action in 1808 and was generally drawn from the Brit’s playbook of enlisting disease-resistant locals to “help.” But in a United States that many expected to throw itself apart — the Civil War bloodbath still a half-century off — it was novel enough to attract President James Madison’s attention. And interesting enough to pull Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson into the fray well before he showed any sign of presidential aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black volunteers in large numbers stepped forward to defend homelands which paradoxically deprived them of basic freedoms for which they fought. Gerard T. Altoff, Amongst My Best Men\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochrane also sweetened the deal — the right to catch a bullet probably seemed cold comfort to a slave — with an immigration masterstroke: Enlisted slaves would be welcomed by the Brits as free settlers to any place in North America or the West Indies where the British flag flew. Not to be outdone, Jackson made a similar offer in an 1814 speech in New Orleans to “Men of Color,” topping it off with “The President of the United States shall be informed of your conduct on the present occasion, and the voice of the representatives of the American nation shall applaud your valor, as your general now praises your ardor.” The good general, it should be noted, owned as many as 300 slaves throughout his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps not so surprisingly, 400 slaves/refugees took Cochrane up on his offer to become “blue jackets” in the Corps of Colonial Marines, grab guns and take a shot at a better life. A shot that started with their first fight at the Battle of Rumley’s Gut in Virginia. British Capt. James Ross, sounding surprised, noted that the corps involvement “was marked by great spirit and vivacity.” Something noted by U.S. leaders as well, who stepped up recruiting efforts and soon had about 500 Black soldiers, also fighting for the promise of some version of freedom. And just to be crystal clear about all of war’s strange bedfellowing, these were Black soldiers shooting and killing white soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Black volunteers in large numbers stepped forward to defend homelands which paradoxically deprived them of basic freedoms for which they fought,” Gerard T. Altoff wrote in Amongst My Best Men: African-Americans and the War of 1812. Despite all the discrimination, Altoff noted, “African-Americans stepped forward to serve, either in a civilian or a military capacity.” Fueled by? Hope, or perhaps a belief in American promises over British guarantees.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the war ended in 1815, battle after battle had been fought with more men lost to disease than combat. The Brits made good on their offers, with some of the soldiers following them to Bermuda, the Bahamas, Trinidad and various other island communities. And the ones who stayed behind? Promptly attacked by Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Negro Fort — a struggle that kicked off the First Seminole War and merciless campaigns against Native Americans.\n",

      "Why the Police Force Needs Hipster Cops\n",
      "The front-page headlines on police brutality just keep rolling. The response has been a kind of national head-scratching. Are body cams the solution? Different training? Or is this the legacy of centuries of structural injustice?\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve got an idea of our own: hipster cops. At least recruit some of them to the force. It sounds a bit insouciant, we know, and it’s true that everyone hates on hipsters for their facial hair and fedoras. But substance-wise, there’s little doubt that the police force could use a shift in culture. Hipsters are as politically correct as you can get, and probably better at working in certain communities. Don’t even get us started on how cool their uniforms would be. Vegan boots, anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jokes aside, the challenge is very real: A recent Gallup poll shows that Americans’ confidence in police has dropped to the lowest level since the Rodney King trial, and subsequent riots, in 1992. Only 52 percent of Americans expressed “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in officers of the law. “Certainly, our image has never been more important than it is now,” says Michael, a lieutenant and 17-year-veteran of a municipal law enforcement agency in California. (Michael didn’t want his last name used.) Diversity on the force could help not just with community relations, he says, but also to usher in and train a new generation of law enforcement leaders. The National Association of Police Organizations did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the pond, no one wants to be a cop. The number of young police officers in England and Wales has fallen by nearly 50 percent in the past two years, according to Britain’s Police Federation. “The problem is police departments want people who are obedient and conformist,” says 32-year-old Jimmy Gallagher, an ex-policeman with London’s Metropolitan Police who left the force because he felt disappointed in its “sheepishness” and now runs Quiffed Owl, a music blog. “The police will never gain the public’s trust if they don’t embrace officers who can think outside the box.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, populating the force with bearded freethinkers may lead to some unruliness. Facial hair and visible tattoos are a no-no in many departments, Michael notes, which would likely disqualify the hipster with “the mustache that does not conform to the decade or even the century.” And judging by how hipsters have become a punchline in recent years, they might struggle to appear authoritative in front of gangsters and old ladies alike. As Cindy Chan, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Toronto explains, “We all are capable of holding more than one social identity, but merging two identities when they are at such odds with each other — that’s a real challenge.”\n",

      "OPEC Report Suggests Massive Oil Price Rebound\n",
      "The headlines reacting to OPEC’s April Oil Market Report generally read “OPEC concerned about global oil demand” and as such, oil prices traded down slightly on April 13, despite an overall positive market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I’m concerned about global oil demand also, so I thought I better read their report. Clearly, the commodity never performs well in the face of stagnant or shrinking economic activity – no commodity does – in fact, nothing does. Except maybe alcohol sales. In any case, I am concerned with exactly how worried OPEC was about global oil demand and by extension, global GDP growth. Guess what? It turns out that despite the green lobby’s insistence, world economic activity is strongly reliant on hydrocarbon consumption and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, what I found in the report was not so much concerns about GDP growth in various regions of the world, although these are expressed and reviewed, but rather the underlying prediction of a massive rebound in oil and gas activity during the second half of 2016! By extension, for non-OPEC production to rebound, the cartel must be assuming much higher oil prices beginning, well, about now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this foreshadowing that a big production cut deal will come out of the Doha Qatar meeting this weekend? Probably not. In any case, I keep thinking, what if OPEC told us oil prices were going up sharply, but they buried the news deep in an 85 page report and nobody noticed? Related: End Of An Era: Peabody Declares Bankruptcy\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe they did. However, the fact is OPEC did not mention surging oil prices or sharp increases in exploration and production activity in their report, but they implied it. As subtle as the implications were, those commentators that managed to read only the first page summary of the report failed to grasp its true meaning. But in fact, to make the numbers add up, the only explanation is that OPEC is very bullish on both oil prices and oil service activity. Let me explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "First it’s necessary to set the backdrop by reviewing oil and gas fundamentals at a 50,000 foot level. Overall, OPEC is expecting that global growth in oil demand (really all liquids demand) in 2016 will average 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d). That is, demand will average 94.2 mb/d vs the 93 mb/d average in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "These estimates are pretty much in line with other analysis like the IEA’s Oil market report (95 mb/d) and represent a slowdown in growth from the 1.5 mb/d increase seen 2014 to 2015. Demand growth is predicated on a global GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent vs 2.9 percent world GDP growth rate in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why OPEC estimates stronger GDP growth but slowing oil demand growth is another question altogether. Setting that aside, OPEC notes stability in first quarter PMI numbers in the U.S., weak, but respectable numbers in Europe and Japan, improving numbers in China and India, etc to support its GDP assumptions…OK I won’t argue. Clearly the risk to 2016 oil demand lies squarely in how reality aligns with these expectations…once again, no surprise there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do the world’s oil producers – battered and bloodied by an 18 month drop in prices - supply the additional 1.2 mb/d of oil the world is expected to burn in 2016? That is the $100 billion dollar question and this is where the fun starts! Why $100 billion? Because that is the magnitude of the reduction in investments in oil and gas development that companies have announced for 2016 relative to 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about private companies and other countries that don’t report to shareholders? Good question, but no doubt they are spending less in 2016 than 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here is where I start to sense that OPECs monthly oil market report and reality have, let’s say, diverged onto different paths. OPEC details how production is essentially falling all over the world after achieving strong growth in 2015. In particular, non-OPEC supplies grew by 1.5 mb/d to reach 57.1 mb/d in 2015. In 2016, noting the aforementioned large drop in CAPEX and the corresponding rig count, non OPEC production is expected to fall by nearly 800,000 bpd.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both cases, U.S. tight oil is leading the way. In particular, U.S. tight oil volumes are falling the fastest. They note that in March, these volumes are expected to be down over 700,000 bpd from their peak in the first quarter of 2015. They also note the falling rig count as a major driver, possibly leading to increasing rates of production declines during 2016. Got it – rig counts drop to the lowest levels since the 1980s, production falls hard. Especially in tight oil where new wells typically decline by 75 percent in their first year of production. No brainer there. Most analysts have realized this.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, what about the current oversupply you ask? Are they not just saying that the market will just absorb the excesses of a currently oversupplied market? Yes. However, based on their own estimates, the market is basically in balance today. As such, here is where their projections start to deviate from logic – or to suggest a rebound is upon us. Below is OPEC’s forecast of non-OPEC production by quarter. The group notes that the world has seen a sharp drop in oil production during the first quarter of 2016. Various sources have already reported much of this information. Importantly, OPEC is predicting larger decreases in production in the second quarter of 2016 as the drop in activity that accelerated last December, really starts to impact production. Once again, this is starting to be accepted by those that pay attention to the data. These declines have recently garnered some press attention and I believe played a role in the recent oil price rebound. Related: Is The Golden Age Of Gas Nothing More Than A Bubble?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all as expected – the global oil industry cannot grow volumes in a $30/bbl oil world. In fact, at that price, cash flows are insufficient to warrant investment even to the levels necessary to replace production – much less grow volumes. Many have been saying this and dropping production is the evidence that they are correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, fast forward to OPEC’s estimate for third quarter 2016. They predict flat production relative to the second quarter. Further, in the fourth quarter, they predict non-OPEC production growth!\n",
      "\n",
      "How will the world achieve this? It will require a massive reversal of capital spending, and therefore a massive increase in the rig count and oil service activity. How massive? We estimate that in the Eagle Ford shale alone, the rig count would have to increase by 100 percent and the working frac fleets by 150 percent just to keep production flat. I have often compared this type of change to turning a supertanker.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at this point, it may be too late! We are going to hit the dock…why? It typically takes six to nine months for rebounding service activity to impact volumes – maybe less in the shale plays? Maybe, we’ll see. But history has shown that most regions react much slower to price changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the previous point aside for a moment, take a look at fourth quarter estimates. Yes, OPEC is predicting that non-OPEC supplies grow by 500,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of 2016. In their estimates – half this growth – 270,000 bpd comes from the Americas with the U.S. leading the pack, growing volumes by 140,000 bpd from Q3 to Q4 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do this, the rig count would have to increase by something on the order of 3x current levels and all other oilfield services would necessarily steeply ramp up. This is achievable, but to get there, I believe would require oil to shoot to around $60-70/bbl and we would have to start right now. My real prediction is a slower ramp through the first half of 2017, mirroring a ramp in oil prices. The good news from this report is that this will happen at minimum, barring collapsing world GDP forecasts or surging OPEC volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, OPEC is not just predicting increasing volumes in the Americas – they are predicting increasing fourth quarter production everywhere! Asia, Latin America and Africa are expected grow volumes by a combined 100,000 bpd off the 3Q 2016 lows while both Russia and China add 50,000 bpd each. Even Europe is expected to kick in growth of 130,000 bpd.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of today, production is falling in all of these regions. Sober analysts have been downgrading production estimates almost universally for the past few months. Likewise, service companies have been steadily lowering revenue estimates for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As such, what changes in the third and fourth quarters? We are in mid-April now. The fourth quarter is only a short 5 months away – the industry better get going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so one does not believe that OPEC is behind the times, they note the massive drop in activity levels that accelerated in the first quarter. Below is an up to date representation of what we are living in the U.S. Far from any kind of rebound, the charts below seem to suggest the industry is going to zero!\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "The momentum of the declines seen in the first quarter further highlight OPEC’s prediction of a second half rebound in volumes. The following is their estimates of both U.S. and total Americas supply growth. In both cases, after falling hard first to second quarter of 2016, volumes are flat in the third quarter and increasing again in the fourth. The only explanation for this is massive reinvestment driven by a massive increase in spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe not. Let’s look at some alternative explanations. Maybe OPEC is scared that shale producers have gotten so good extracting oil from impermeable rock that only a slight pickup in price may lead to massive new volumes. OPEC cites a quote by Pioneer Natural Resources that said they could put as many as five rigs back to work if oil stabilized above $45/bbl. With Pioneer’s rig count dropping from over 40 to 12 in the past 12 months, five incremental rigs is not going to spell rebounding U.S. production. Related: Tesla And Other Tech Giants Scramble For Lithium As Prices Double\n",
      "\n",
      "While the industry is getting more and more efficient, the laws of large numbers are immutable. With tens of thousands of horizontal wells declining daily, several thousand new wells are required to replace these volumes, and there is no evidence of any rebound yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the bottom line for OPEC. In the following chart, “required” OPEC production – meaning volumes required to balance the global market which considers the inputs of supply and demand for the world– are shown in the orange line. The blue bars are actual OPEC production. With actual production exceeding “required” production, global inventories rise and the oil price tanks. Historically, OPEC would pull a few barrels off the market to assure this didn’t happen. In November of 2014 they famously didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, assuming flat OPEC volumes, based on this chart, supply and demand are effectively in balance in 3Q 2016. In fact, demand slightly exceeds supply implying that high global inventories begin to drop. This is the point where prices stabilize and begin to rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth quarter, as shown, demand for OPEC volumes is falling. However, keep in mind that this is predicated on increasing production volumes from the rest of the world. An assumption that could only come true if a massive rebound in oil prices and activity started today.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Click to enlarge)\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, what is likely to happen is the third quarter call on OPEC will be about 1 mb/d above supply, resulting in strong inventory draws. This will push oil prices to the highest levels seen at least over the past 12 months. Given this signal, the industry will start to put capital back to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this will take a while – most of those laid off last year and this have found other jobs. Remember the 6-9 month lag between increases in rig count and volume growth? It could be even longer before volumes are truly growing again. If not in the U.S., certainly in the most of the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, let’s say fourth quarter is flat with our revised third quarter. Then the call on OPEC would be around 1.5 mb/d, resulting in further reductions in global inventories. In addition, oil prices would likely head higher and the strip would enter backwardation, prompting further draws from inventories. Under this scenario, non-OPEC volumes are unlikely to grow sufficiently to meet global demand until the second half of 2017. To achieve this, rising oil prices are just around the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every cycle, analysts and pundits try to make sense of the current environment. When oil prices were above $100/bbl, many argued such high prices were necessary because global F&D costs had risen to that point. Likewise, at the bottom, many have argued that $30/bbl is the new price level and given OPEC’s low marginal costs, prices could not rise. Neither was true. Prices and supplies are cyclical and the oil market is self-correcting. Wells decline daily. Cash must be invested in large quantities just to keep production flat and even in larger quantities to grow production.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, the only way OPEC can make these projections is through sharply rebounding oil prices. Further, to make these numbers, this has to begin now. So in reality, maybe they are telling us without actually telling us, that they are about to hit us with a price shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think so. I think they want to avoid any such messy outcome. However, we can recognize that the correction process is happening. But the rebound in investment is nowhere in sight making it unlikely that volume declines suddenly stop and then reverse in the second half of 2016. What this really tells me is that prices got out of control, dropped much further than the cartel expected, but they couldn’t reverse course without losing credibility. Maybe we all will be better off when they just leave markets alone.\n",

      "Getty | Krystalina Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few years, when you pull cash out of the ATM, you may end up looking at a woman's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost a year ago, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced that a woman would appear on the $10 bill. But the popularity of the musical Hamilton, and renewed interest in the man, complicated matters. So now, rumors are circulating that Lew will announce that Hamilton will stay on the $10, a woman will appear on the $20, and Andrew Jackson, whose face currently occupies the front of the $20 note, will move to the back. Replacing him on the front, reportedly, will be Harriet Tubman, who won the Women on 20s online poll last spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to imagine a more fitting choice: A woman born into slavery who shepherded so many enslaved people to freedom through her Underground Railroad taking the place of a mass murderer, a genocidal man who worked as a slave trader and went on to force tens of thousands of Native Americans off their land through the Indian Removal Act, many of them dying on the Trail of Tears. If there were ever a guy to kick off the currency, Jackson is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what a woman to take that spot. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery in her 20s, fleeing Maryland for Philadelphia — and immediately returning to smuggle her family north. She went back down to the South again and again, bringing more slaves north, even helping to ferry people to Canada when the Fugitive Slave Law left them vulnerable even in Northern states. Tubman famously \"never lost a passenger\" on her Underground Railroad, and her work earned her the nickname \"Moses.\" She started out as a nurse in the Union Army before becoming a spy and an armed scout — she freed at least 700 enslaved people in the Combahee River Raid as the first woman in the war to lead an armed expedition. After the war, she was also an activist for women's voting rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubman's service to her nation, though, went under-recognized in her lifetime, and she lived in a state of financial stress. The standard war veteran pension at the time was $25 a month; after the death of her second husband, Tubman was granted $8 a month. After a year of fighting, Congress gave her a little bit more: $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "That her face could be on that bill sends a strong message: In a country where little matters more than money, women matter too. It would be nice if we could put the face of a female president on the bill, but we've never had one of those. And it would be nice if we could say that the kind of gender discrimination Tubman faced when she was given an $8 pension and then a $20 one was a thing of the past, but still, women make a fraction of what men do — and black women make even less.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain a country in which women are in many cases second-class citizens, facing unequal treatment, left largely out of leadership positions, and marginalized in politics. For every woman in Congress, there are four men. A woman just may win the presidency this year, but she will be the first in 200 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman on the $20 bill won't fix any of this. But the way boys understand what it means to be men and girls understand what it means to be women is through a complex interplay of adults modeling behavior, cultural norms, and symbolism. When our representations of leadership and patriotism are all white men, it sends a message that leadership and patriotism are male things. That message can't be countered only with the promise that girls can be anything they want to be, contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Tubman on the $20 makes clear that women have shaped this country for the better and have made invaluable contributions — contributions they made despite being largely barred from political participation. That she will replace a man who engineered a genocide of this county's native population could not be more appropriate or more reflective of how much times may have changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming, that is, that times actually have changed and it happens. There's no confirmation yet from the Treasury Department, and it seems that even if Tubman (or any woman) replaces Jackson on the $20, it'll be 14 years until any of us actually see her face in green. That's more than three times as long as the Civil War and comes after a century of women waiting to see a female face on a bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women have waited long enough, and Americans have had to stare at Andrew Jackson's face coming out of the ATM for far too long. In a few years, cash may be obsolete and we'll all be paying with cards or our phones or some sort of retina scanner hooked directly to our Bitcoin stash. Sometime before that, it would be nice to open my wallet and see a few Tubmans inside.\n",

      "\n",
      "The most popular reasoning behind Daryl being killed off is that he has a new series on AMC called Ride with Norman Reedus. Many fans suspect this will create a scheduling conflict and was only greenlit because Reedus has plenty of free time following Daryl's death in the season six finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another theory that has been gaining some steam in comment sections is one regarding the \"point of view\" style the episode concluded with. Throughout the finale, the camera showed a certain character's perspective as they were locked up in the back of the Saviors' van where Rick and the group would eventually be trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only candidates, in this case, are Glenn, Michonne, Daryl, and Rosita. Rosita's death would have very little impact on the show. Rick would have almost certainly interjected if Michonne were the victim and Glenn's death wouldn't surprise fans with knowledge of the comics. Daryl's death makes an impact on the story line and also shocks fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, most cast members have said they either don't know who the victim is or elected not to talk about it. Norman Reedus, on the other hand, went on Good Morning America to say that he knows what happens and called it \"gutwrenching.\" Could he be the only one to know because it's him?\n",

      "Every time I waddled into her office, deep in the throes of the third trimester of my third pregnancy, 65 pounds heavier than my normal self and peeing myself every time I coughed, my midwife would gush, \"You look so beautiful.\"\n",

But I didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I had to practice deep breathing just to quell the panic that I was never going to fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans again. I wish someone had told me it's OK to feel more like a clump of hair in a shower drain than a maternal goddess on a mountaintop. I wasn't going to mommy hell for daring to think something negative about the process of cooking my little one. It's a gross process. It's weird. It's foreign. And that's OK too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perspective is a funny thing. I look back at photos of myself when I was pregnant and feel sexy. I looked far more inviting and voluptuous than I thought I did at the time. But I haven't forgotten how waddling about in a body so different from the athletic one I'd taken for granted wasn't easy. For weight-conscious women, it can feel terrifying, like a complete loss of control. It wasn't fat-shaming to say I felt ugly. It was an acknowledgement of my truth: My body was changing. Possibly for good. I wasn't able to run as fast or jump as far or get into the deep backbends that are part of my daily yoga practice. Would I ever get it back? I was scared.\n",

      "\n",
      "This isn't to say that the people who tell us we are lovely when we are preggo are lying. Quite the contrary. Even though I hated my body when I was pregnant just two short years ago, I find myself gushing to pregnant women: \"You are glowing,\" \"Wow, pregnancy becomes you,\" or, \"You have never looked better.\"\n",

But I should know better than anyone that if they aren't feeling it, it doesn't matter what I say. Yes, there are women who felt gorgeous when they were pregnant, sure. But once you get a group of seasoned mamas chatting, you quickly find out those of us in the ugly preggo club are not alone. \"I never felt less attractive than when I was knocked up,\" one friend told a group of us when we were chatting about our pregnant bodies.\n",

Maybe it's not the fat we hate, but the sudden notion that our bodies are public property, subject to the judgment and belly rubs of any passing stranger.\n",

      "As a pregnant woman, what I wanted more than anything was to feel like myself. So I'm declaring a moratorium on all the \"glow\" talk. From now on, when I see a pregnant woman, I plan to compliment her outfit, her smile, her work accomplishments. If I must bring up appearance, a simple \"you look lovely\" will do the trick, and if she complains and says she feels anything but, I promise not to argue.

      "Molly Love: Resorting to Ecstasy for Intimacy\n",
      "Jessica Williams had never done molly, but a guy friend offered it to her at a house party. She’s not one to say no to new experiences, so she took the pill and swallowed it. A couple of hours later, after some flirting and back-and-forth, all she wanted to do was talk and get to know Ryan Callen, deeply. They ditched the party and spent the next several hours sitting on his bed, face-to-face and cross-legged, talking about their fears, ambitions and most closely guarded secrets. “Everything just seemed so real, like we were both saying exactly what we were feeling,” she says. Yes, there was physical chemistry, but it was the emotional intimacy that surprised them both. He asked her then and there to be with him, to date exclusively. She said yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day she woke up worried it was just “molly love.” The thought of dating him hadn’t ever crossed her mind. “It sounds so wild, but I honestly don’t think I would have been with him if it wasn’t for that night of MDMA,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "MDMA isn’t new, and neither is research into its effects on human connection, but it wasn’t until the very early 2000s that the FDA warmed to the idea of new research into the potential legal uses of MDMA. It remains banned as a Schedule 1 drug — these range from marijuana to heroin— but under the law could be used in FDA-approved research settings. Psychedelics are now considered by some to be a legitimate cure for trauma, and it’s “highly unlikely” that there will be any turning back, argues Brad Burge, the communications director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), the organization running the nationwide studies. Publicly available psychedelic-assisted therapy is on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, MDMA is making other kinds of strides. Having been popularized for its use in partying and treating PTSD, it’s finding love with a new crowd — PR people, finance guys, social-media managers — people who aren’t trying to fix anything or get fucked up. Rather, they’re seeking an experience with something less sensational but perhaps ultimately more exciting: intimacy.\n",

      "The intimacy in question, and in demand, is not just the sexual kind. Christina Miller, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate who’s applying to med school, got into one of those fights with a friend that left them both angry and silent. That is, until that friend showed up to a gathering rolling hard on MDMA. All of the issues were forgotten, says Miller, thanks to that extra dose of artificial love. The resolution lasted. “If she didn’t do molly that night, we might not have been friends,” says Miller. People also use it to find a truer sense of their own selves. “Ecstasy can really open your heart,” says former porn star and sex worker advocate Annie Sprinkle, adding that it can also remind you how to feel good when you’ve forgotten. When she was 32 and living in Manhattan, she was going through a dark patch and started doing MDMA alone, as a kind of therapy. She would sit in front of the mirror and hiss “like a Medusa,” combining it with masturbation and “deep profound sexual release.” She was letting go of her self-doubt. At the end, she says, it was the first time she truly ever loved herself.\n",

MDMA puts memories in the right “filing cabinet” so they don’t rule your present life, Alison McQueen says, one of just a handful of psychedelic therapists in the U.S. For Ashley Jenkins, a 57-year-old sexual assault victim who’s suffered decades of PTSD, it allowed her to revisit painful experiences without reliving them. For the intimacy seekers, biologically, it increases the output of the feel-good signal senders in the brain like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, making you feel happier, more open and more touchy-feely. Megan Stubbs, a sexologist living in New York, says we live in this “hypersexualized” culture but that “there’s a disconnect trying to bring [sex] into daily life.” She argues that MDMA could bridge that gap for millennial women in particular. After all, 2.5 of the 2.6 million MDMA users in the U.S. are between 14 and 34, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. And the moment may be ripe, especially with feminism’s enduring pop-culture rise, with mainstream celebs and politicians using the word once saved for more leftist circles. It’s all about the touchy-feelies and openness, after all, generally considered “feminine” traits. One government study showed that teenage girls are more likely than boys to have tried the drug. On the flipside, crediting drugs with making people more sexual has its dangers. “It has to be a holistic view,” Stubbs says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this new era of MDMA use has its roots in what our conservative readers might call hippie bullshit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Stubbs says there are “mostly benefits” of MDMA for sex, since it makes people feel more intimate and more open to positive experiences, she cites “Intimate Insight,” a 2015 Journal of Psychopharmacology study that shows MDMA changes the way people talk about and to their significant others. Matthew Baggott, the lead researcher from the University of Chicago, and his co-researchers from Columbia University and the University of Southern California found that MDMA caused them to be more comfortable in their own skin and increased emotional connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve been waiting for us to bring up the guys in the Volkswagen vans and Yoko Ono T-shirts, your wait is over. Yes, this all has its roots in what our conservative readers might call hippie bullshit. Alexander Shulgin, the medical chemist and psychopharmacologist known as the godfather of ecstasy, had a special group of friends-slash-research-subjects, a close-knit crew of academics, business leaders and hippies. He would invite couples over to dinner to test new psychedelic compounds he concocted in his dirt-floor garden shed in California’s Berkeley Hills. The six-foot-four scientist would bring out a new potion, and after warning his guests of its possible effects, they would embark on a psychedelic voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "These dinner parties were some of the earlier tests in MDMA-related couples therapy. Shulgin synthesized an easy-made version of MDMA in 1976, a drug originally patented by German pharmaceutical company Merck in 1912 but quickly abandoned. He asked his friend and LSD creator Albert Hofmann what he thought of the new love potion. Hofmann responded, “Finally, something I can do with my wife.” A couple of years later, drawing on his dinner-party experiments, he published a paper calling MDMA “an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones.” Others caught on, like his psychologist friend Leo Zeff, a so-called underground therapist who used the chemical with thousands of patients, secretly. Shulgin’s drug-as-couples-therapy idea caught on and by the early 1980s, around 1,000 therapists were doing intensive MDMA therapy sessions, like Dr. George Greer, Zeff’s protégé, who tested the substance on 80 patients. He became the go-to guy on research and found that when they gave it to a couple together, their “intimate conversation” improved. And the effects lasted for months. Greer says it works this way: It blocks the neuropsychological fear response to a perceived emotional threat, so people aren’t afraid to say things. In general, they were “less defensive” when talking about relationship trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of high-profile deaths got the attention of the DEA and they banned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But love-inducing MDMA also helps some people get laid. And by the mid-1980s a quick and dirty version made it onto the Dallas club scene. Which might have brought us to the present-day experimentations with intimacy … except for the things that started going wrong. A couple of high-profile deaths got the attention of the DEA and they banned it. Practically overnight. Government money for research vanished. And this all happened against the backdrop of the booming crack epidemic and then–First Lady Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign. Ecstasy and intimacy receded into the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their fears weren’t unfounded. The molly sold on the street can be adulterated, and even in its purest form, MDMA has risks. The National Institutes of Health notes it’s not a benign drug — adverse effects range from chills and hypertension to heart or kidney failure. MDMA-induced hyperthermia can be fatal. And for those with cardiac issues, MDMA is particularly dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "And no one is saying that the resurgence is a recipe for happiness ever after. Or that MDMA is a silver bullet against ugly divorce rates. Drugs and relationships don’t always mix. Like the scene in season five of Mad Men in which Roger and Jane, two of the main characters, are lying on a furry rug at home, tripping on LSD. Their blissed-out state gives them calm clarity about their marriage … that it’s over. That’s part of the deal with psychedelics. They’re “mind manifesting,” the literal meaning of the word, and becoming aware of your inner thoughts can be brutal. Couples therapy is hard enough without the influence of drugs, says Constance Avery-Clark, a seasoned sex therapist and member of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research, adding that therapists “can’t compete” with drugs. She’s hesitant about any upside.\n",
      "\n",
      "But imagine walking down the street in any city and having access to psychotherapy clinics — cozy rooms with Persian rugs, calming music, green plants and trained therapists — where people can check in, stay the night and go home the next day, healed. Eventually these in-patient centers would treat all sorts of people, from bickering couples to Boomers who want to have freer sex. Burge thinks this will happen “within the next decade,” if not sooner. Meanwhile, the adventurous experiment in private, sometimes with life-changing results. “When you take MDMA, it completely fast-forwards, times a thousand, intimacy and relationships, and without that I wouldn’t be with who I am today. I’d look at him as just a friend,” says Williams. And today, she couldn’t be happier.\n",

      "The Walking Dead cast are as much a family as their characters are on our TV screens. When one of the characters is killed off, both of those families lose a member. That's why Andrew Lincoln and the group aren't ready to talk about which character met their doom when Negan brought his bat down on their skull.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We kind of made a pact with each other, just because personally and professionally one of us is going,\" Lincoln tells ComicBook.com in an exclusive interview. \"These people are lovely, dear friends. Including myself one of us is gonna get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking to Lincoln earlier this week, it would've been foolish not to ask if he knows who the victim is. As it turns out, the scene hasn't been shot in its entirety but Lincoln still isn't willing to give up any info.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We all just made a pact not to discuss it,\" Lincoln explains. \"It's upsetting. It's too precious. There are certain things that become sacred on set and I'm afraid, I'm one of these people going, 'I can't talk about it.' Every time we've lost somebody on the show they've been instrumental in story telling. It's the same thing. We lock up shop. We linked arms, got our knees, and said, 'You know what? Let's not discuss this. It's painful. No apologies.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the cast or crew seem to be giving any hints as to who was killed off. Fans have been speculating and going as far as drawing up their detective works to try and figure it out but it looks like we'll have to wait for the show to come back to find out exactly what happened.\n",

      "Remember Fast and Furious? No, not the series of vehicle-themed Vin Diesel and Rock vehicles. The bizarre “gunwalking” scandal, in which the ATF let straw buyers purchase guns to traffic to Mexico, but intercept the firearms before they reached Mexico, snagging criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been mostly out of the news for the last four years, but on Friday, the White House announced it would drop claims of executive privilege and turn over a cache of documents to Congress related to Fast and Furious, as Politico’s Josh Gerstein first reported. The decision follows a court defeat in January for the Obama administration. Gerstein explains:\n",
      "\n",
      "In her ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson did not turn down Obama's privilege assertion on the merits. Instead, she said authorized public disclosures about the operation in a Justice Department inspector general report essentially mooted the administration's drive to keep the records secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the latest round in an ongoing battle between the White House and congressional Republicans over the operation. Almost inevitably, Fast and Furious was a fiasco. It didn’t snag any big fish, and the ATF lost track of 2,000 guns, including two that were found after the 2010 murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. The dispute is not over whether Fast and Furious failed, but over who is to blame. The Obama administration and the Department of Justice pinned the blame on the local ATF office in Phoenix. Republicans suggested that higher-ups—including the Attorney General Eric Holder or even President Obama—might have known.\n",

      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, speaks during a U.S. Labor Department news conference at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, April 6, 2016. Drew Angerer—Bloomberg via Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Having to do your taxes stinks, and Elizabeth Warren feels your pain. On Wednesday the Massachusetts senator introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016, which would put the onus for crunching the numbers and figuring how much you'll get back or owe on the IRS. Many people wouldn't have to deal with a tax return at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of other countries currently have setups like this, and the idea of return-free filing has had bipartisan appeal in the past (Ronald Reagan talked about it back in 1985, Vox pointed out). But in her proposal, Warren said the tax preparation industry has blocked efforts to implement something similar in this country, just to protect their business interests. \"Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes each year, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry,\" she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The IRS currently offers a program called Free File , but it's so convoluted, only 3% of taxpayers bother with it. Since the IRS already gets copies of all the tax forms, like W-2s and 1099s, that are mailed to taxpayers, Warren wants to make it the agency's job to fill in the blanks on your return, then send it to you to make sure it's right—basically the opposite of how it works now, where you have to do all of the legwork and hope you don't forget or miscalculate something that's going to get you audited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such a system would save taxpayers time and money, and would result in more accurate tax returns,\" Warren's office said in a report about the hassle factor of filling out and filing tax documents. Return-free filing would cut down the average 13 hours American spend working on their taxes to just minutes, the report noted, and save filers the average $200 each spends on tax prep help.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, the CEO and president, respectively, of Zenger/Folkm, a leadership consulting business, designed a “boldness index” from a database of assessments from 75,000 leaders around the world. They found that “women on average rank in the 52nd percentile of boldness, a few ticks higher than the average men rating of the 49th percentile.” If that doesn’t seem like a big difference, that’s because it’s not. But their conclusion defies the conventional wisdom that women are biologically more harmonious and risk-averse compared to their fractious and ambitious male counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the components of their index, published in the Harvard Business Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges standard approaches\n",

      "Some might call the compilation of all those traits “innovative,” “smart,” or even “common sensical”—they are leaders after all. And the index says nothing of the epic double standards women face around “being bold” and taking risks: aggressive men are leaders, aggressive women are difficult; men lead boldly, women are bossy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s clearly an issue to be addressed because when Zenger and Folkman analyzed their data to see how these traits materialized across different business functions. They found that in every function, women on average were braver, or more creative than men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context, they found, also matters: When they broke individuals into age groups, the data showed women step it up when they are in jobs dominated by the other sex. Women age 30 and under rated in the 62nd percentile for boldness in male-dominated functions like sales, but only the 42nd percentile in female-dominated roles such as engineering and safety. That could be because naturally bold women gravitate to those jobs, or because women in those jobs find they are most successful harnessing those traits.\n",

      "I suppose I could have kept searching, but really, who was going to hire a woman who would be asking for maternity leave in seven months, legal or not? There is no way I would have not disclosed that information, so I took a part-time job in a bookstore to keep me occupied throughout my pregnancy and earn a little money to put towards the baby gear we'd eventually need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once my son arrived, that $450-a-month student-loan payment was a larger black hole in our monthly budget than ever. Had I not had student-loan debt, finances would definitely have been a little more cushioned than they were. I breastfed and used cloth diapers, yet finances were still incredibly tight. I can't imagine what we would have done had we needed to purchase formula and disposable diapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the amount doesn't seem terribly big, for a family living paycheck to paycheck, $450 is the difference between being able to have a break and order takeout with a newborn, or having to shuffle around in the kitchen, half-asleep with a baby strapped to your chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in my life, I wasn't earning an income, forced to rely on my husband for grocery money and any other purchase I wished to make. As I sat rocking my newborn, I found myself without a familiar identity (career) and in the awkward position of not contributing to our household financially. My husband was now paying my student loan payment — for me to sit at home and change diapers, a fact that I couldn't get out of my head. It just didn't add up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't really add up for me to go back to work either. If I were to return to work full-time, working in a creative field, I would be spending more than half of my income on daycare. I was also caught in a Catch-22 situation; I would need to work to be able to afford the down-payment for a daycare slot, since we were living paycheck to paycheck, but working would be impossible without daycare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sad thing about this situation? I knew I was not alone. In fact, I was in parenting groups with women facing the same dilemma as myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband was paying over $450 a month for degrees he didn't earn, while I was at home nursing a baby, washing dirty diapers and losing my mind with fatigue (and boredom). I spent much of my time wracked with guilt for not contributing to our household financially, alternating between being jealous and grateful that my husband had a job, and adjusting to going without many extras in our lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "2026. I have a number that represents an end-date, and a hefty balance to back that up. That payoff date has come to represent many things in my life — things I can quantify, assign meaning, put my figurative finger on. What I don't have is a number representing the years I've had with my son, able to nurture him while I stayed at home doing nothing remotely close to what my monthly student loan payment signified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I'm still at home, raising my son, now working from home while he attends nursery school three days a week. Everything about this feels right, despite feeling wrong for the first few years. What I do know is that 2026 is more imaginable now than it was in 1995. My son will be in middle school, and I will have had time with him that I can never, ever quantify.\n",

      "The United Arab Emirates wants to build a full-size artificial mountain to encourage rainfall\n",
      "The United Arab Emirates is used to building landmasses were there were none before, but creating a mountain from scratch is a whole new level. Nonetheless, the UAE is considering precisely that kind of construction. With hopes that it will encourage raincloud development in a country mostly covered in desert, the UAE is looking to build a full-sized artificial mountain. Desert flatlands make it difficult for air to get the upward climb required to collect into rain clouds, but creating a mountain could help bring a certain amount of rain to the otherwise arid region.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage, increased rainfall might be more suitable in, say, drought-ravaged California than a country naturally situated in the middle of the desert, but that’s beside the point. The UAE has commissioned a proposal from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in collaboration with the National Center of Meteorology and Seismology (NCAR), both United States-based scientific collectives. Researchers are currently looking to determine if this type of mountain construction would be possible in the UAE at all, let alone what the dimensions of the mountain would have to be in order to encourage a significant change in meteorological patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Dubai is building a $1 billion skyscraper that may be the tallest in the world\n",

      "The mountain just needs to increase cloud formation, not necessarily the formation of rainclouds specifically, says Roelof Bruintjes, scientist and lead researcher on the NCAR team. Once clouds begin to form, a meteorological process called cloud seeding increases the amount of rainfall that those clouds can release. But it looks like construction of the mountain itself is still only in the wishful thinking phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before any construction can begin on this artificial mountain in the UAE, the scientists and researchers at the NCAR have been tasked with pricing out the possibility of the project. If the government of the UAE decides that the projected price is feasible (with or without help from the deep pockets of local private investors in cities like Dubai), only then will a team of engineers tackle the project to see if building a mountain in the middle of the desert is physically possible.\n",

      "This Skills Gap Is Hurting America’s Housing Market\n",
      "While America’s housing market is recovering, the construction industry has struggled to catch up. Nationwide, the median price for existing and new single-family homes for sale shot up more than 8% during the past year. The rise, in part, signals good news in that the housing market has continued to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, but prices are also being driven up by a growing shortage of homebuilders and home improvement professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve heard plenty about America’s skills gap across the tech industry, but a skills gap is also hobbling construction — and it’s delaying building projects, shrinking building inventories, and inflating the cost of homes and home-related projects. The knowledge and skills necessary to repair our toilets, install our furnaces and build our houses are dying on the vine. And, unless we want our grandkids growing up in primeval teepees, we need to work quickly to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trend has been building up for years. In the 1990s, the American educational system (no doubt with the best of intentions) discontinued vocational classes and began to encourage all students to pursue a four-year college degree, creating significant, if unintended, consequences. First, fewer students were exposed to career options in the skilled labor trades. Second, the profound emphasis placed on college-level education perpetuated the notion that skilled (i.e., blue-collared) labor entails physically demanding, yet mindless work. And third, industry succession responsibilities were transferred to business owners lacking the time and resources required to fully train and educate would-be workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortage worsened in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the dark days of the housing crisis led the construction industry to lose more than 60% of its workforce to healthier industries, according to the U.S. Labor Statistics and Census Bureaus. That’s more than any other non-farm industry in the United States. One contributor, of course, has been diminishing immigration. The U.S. construction industry has lost more than half a million Mexican-born workers since 2007, according to a recent report by home-building analyst John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc , mostly as a result of increasingly restrictive domestic immigration policies and improving opportunities abroad. In an erratic election year, this has been a widely debated, hot-button issue.\n",

      "A lesser-debated, but no less impactful, contributor to the skilled labor shortage has been an ever-widening generational gap in the skilled labor workforce. During the Great Recession, fewer young people were hired, which meant the percentage of older workers in the industry grew faster than in other industries. As the U.S. Census notes: The percentage of 19- to 25-year-olds hired in the construction sector declined from approximately 18% at its peak before 2006 to 13% in 2012-2013, only to be replaced with workers 45 to 55 years old . As a result, the percentage of 45- to 55-year-olds employed in the construction sector has exceeded the employment share of this age group in all other industries. Increasingly, these older workers are aging out of the workforce altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as the housing market recovers today, the construction industry is playing catch up. The National Association of Home Builders reports that, although the residential construction industry has gained more than 433,000 positions since the lowest low following the Great Recession, the industry remains more than 1 million workers short of the workforce seen at peak 2006 levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homebuilding and home services businesses are stunted. Construction is expected to add jobs at the second-fastest rate among U.S. industries between 2014 and 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts , but business owners are struggling to fill open positions. In a recent HomeAdvisor survey , we found that 93% of home service professionals believe their businesses would grow in the next 12 months if not for hiring challenges. Further, while half of respondents plan to hire one to three skilled workers in the next 12 months, 76% feel it will be hard to find qualified new employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry’s staffing shortages are also spawning major project delays — not to mention operational cost increases that are being passed on to consumers. In a June 2015 National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) survey , 58% of builders reported having difficulty completing projects on time, and 61% of builders reported raising home prices due to labor shortages in the previous 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a home services CEO, I see first-hand the impacts of the labor gap on our industry, our economy and our continued quality of life. Regrettably, I also see that it’s only going to get worse if we don’t make it better. With fewer migrant workers entering the workforce and an increasing number of aging skilled workers making their exit, there’s a need to attract and engage a healthy workforce to take over the essential roles they’re leaving behind. Fortunately, there are a number of things we can do to foster an interest in skilled labor among the nation’s younger workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we can reconnect the industry with educational institutions and seasoned professionals to reintroduce — and encourage — long-term career options in the skilled labor trades. Second, we can embolden entrepreneurship in young workers and underscore the great autonomy, flexibility and growth potential the industry affords. And finally, we can harness millennials’ newfound celebration of craftsmanship to tap into the “maker movement” and better position skilled laborers as the essential, authentic craftsmen young workers may aspire to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without skilled workers to replenish a diminishing skilled labor workforce, housing prices will continue to rise, housing inventories will continue to fall, and we’ll pay a growing premium for even the smallest home repairs (until there’s nobody left who knows how to complete them). So, whatever we do to address the skilled labor shortage, it’s imperative that we do something — and that we do something soon. Skilled labor has reached a breaking point, and if we continue to do nothing, our houses — so long as we can afford to keep them — will literally fall to pieces.\n",

      "When former Sister, Sister star and cooking show host Tia Mowry posted to Instagram a photo of herself looking ~*fInE~*, a troll who went by the handle @miekk_ (but has since deleted her profile) left an obnoxious comment on the post: \"Getting fat.\"\n",

      "Instead of ignoring or deleting the unsolicited feedback, Tia totally called @miekk_ out with a screenshot of the comment and an epic clapback:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tia wrote in her caption:\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't normally do this, but I wanted to prove a point. I just posted a few days ago about embracing and uplifting others about body image. Here, @miekk_felt the need to say I was getting fat. I took a look at your profile and I was sad to see that you WORK for YOUNG African American girls aiding in their studies. I hope this isn't what you would tell your girls? Does your BOSS know that this is how you degrade other WOMAN? @hbcutravelers Internet BULLYING is not cool and it needs to stop. Would you say this to my face? Is this how you speak to yourself when YOU look at yourself in the mirror. Again, I'm shining a light on this issue hoping to see change. Love and uplift! This is not just about me getting called fat. This isn't just about me. I could care less! I'm standing up for the people that like to hide behind computers cyber bulling calling many gay, skinny, slut, ugly, fat, the list goes on and on. Cyber bullying needs to stop!\n",

      "\n",
      "In what could have been a boss move, Tia did a little research and deduced that her Internet bully worked for HBCU Travelers, a nonprofit organization that encourages young African-American women to travel. Because critiquing a woman's body contradicts the mission of any organization created to empower women, employing a fat shamer can be construed as hypocritical. Tia tagged the organization to draw attention to their employee's behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "HBCU Travelers responded with a post of their own, which sympathizes with Tia, but also highlights her factual error: @miekk_ doesn't work for said organization, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The young lady you mentioned does not work for our organization, but was a supporter of our mission,\" HBCU Travelers wrote. \"It saddens me that she made the negative remark. We will be sure to use this incident to stand out against negativity!\"\n",

      "If you were looking forward to the Apple Watch 2.0 in 2016, a well-known analyst has just thrown a nice bucket of ice-cold water on the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Apple Insider, KGI Securities analyst and Apple oracle Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple is working on an Apple Watch \"S\" update, one that will leave the current design intact, but refresh numerous internal components. As a result, the next Apple Watch could be faster, have a longer battery life and a slightly better screen, but look exactly like the last one.\n",

      "\n",
      "Incremental changes should come as no surprise in a market as immature as smartwatches. Littered with the corpses of failed wearables, it’s a market that merits a cautious approach. And perhaps Apple’s position as the big fish in a small pond of wearable competitors probably gives it the right to set the tone. Even as Apple’s somewhat halting approach to Apple Watch updates frustrates those who’ve come to expect bold, yearly updates on major product categories (like the iPhone), it would be foolish to mess with the design and major functions when you can incrementally build, quarter over quarter, to a sustainable business. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "For 12 months, that’s meant one major software update (watch OS 2, the one that delivered many long-promised features), some new materials and lots and lots of stylish band options.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the Apple Watch. I’ve been wearing one on and off for a year and appreciate the excellent forward-leaning design (yes, I feel like I’m wearing a watch from the future) and the ever-present notifications and alerts. It really does free me from pulling my iPhone out of my pocket and, even to this day, I get “wow” or “cool” comments from TSA personnel and ticketing agents when I check into flights with the Apple Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, I’m the person Apple could always count on to buy an Apple Watch. Not just because I’m a tech geek, but because I’m a middle-aged guy who grew up wearing watches.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Apple (and other wearable manufacturers) want to grow beyond people like me, it has to make a number of key changes sooner, as opposed to later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough fashion\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, Apple, we get it: You’re fashion-conscious and know how to convince upscale designers into making gorgeous Apple Watch bands. Most recently Apple and Hermes partnered to offer yet even more colors!\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple knows better than anyone that colors do not equal innovation. I wonder, though, if they understand that there’s a limit to how far you can push the Apple Watch as an upscale fashion accessory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Apple want to grow beyond people like me, it has to make a number of key changes sooner, as opposed to later\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving aside the 18K gold edition, Apple actually appears to have a lot of choice in the Apple Watch line. Near the top, you have the gorgeous, $1,100+ watches, with chrome link, Milanese and wrap-around Hermes leather band options.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the other end of the spectrum, you find, thanks to a recent $50 price drop, the $299 anodized-aluminum Sport with either fluromaster or woven nylon bands. (For the record, I’m tired of people calling things “Sport.” The name brings with it an inferred pressure to be active. Maybe some people just want to wear a watch.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a whole bunch of watch material and band color options, as well as a healthy collection of customizable watch faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple should go further\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m willing to accept that Apple will not introduce a redesigned Apple Watch now — and maybe not at any point this year — but there is one more body option they should consider because I think it could help them take the Apple Watch outside the fashion realm and, perhaps, into a space first pioneered by Swatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Apple Watch material should be a polymer (yes, basically a super-strong plastic).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of obvious benefits. First of all, the cheaper material will allow Apple to price what I like to call the Apple Watch Lite at $199. As most Apple historians will recall, $199 is what the late Steve Jobs called the magic price for technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "A polymer body would also allow for an endless number of through-and-through body colors. If you scratch the Apple Watch Lite, you won’t see unsightly metal, just more of the same color. It would also allow Apple to introduce patterned fluromaster bands and have the pattern carry through to the watch. Just think, a Hello Kitty Apple Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lower price should attract more Apple Watch customers. To bring in the customers who have never worn a watch, though, Apple will need to do at least, uh, one more thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this material and price change, Apple should introduce a whole new set of design partners, ones less concerned with fashion and more tapped into culture, especially teen couture. This was the Swatch approach, which, to some extent, still works today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bands, bodies and, more importantly, Apple Watch Lite faces would obviously start pre-loaded with faces to match the band and body designs. Imagine a kid Apple Watch with a Snoopy face, or a One Direction watch with the four remaining band members dotting the four corners of a watch face. Connecting Apple Watch design and interfaces to teen cultural touchstones would not only put the Apple Watch in demand for the Snapchat set, but turn each new design partner release into a cultural event.\n",
      "\n",
      "More work\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other things I would like Apple to do right now in lieu of a redesign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rethink digital touches. The idea of doodling to someone or sending them my heartbeat was fun for a few weeks, but it’s been months since I’ve used them. Apple should either make digital touches more visible on the watch or replace the functionality with a Snapchat function that lets you doodle or put text on watch face screen shots (or photos pulled from your iPhone) and send them along to friends who also have Apple Watch or those who don’t (just make it a Snapchat snap or iMessage).\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a One Direction Apple Watch Lite with the four-remaining band members dotting the four corners of a watch face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dump the app home screen. The more apps that appear in Apple Watch’s random app bubble cluster, the harder it gets to find anything. Most of the time, you’re not launching apps anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Apple Watch is at its best when telling time and delivering notifications, alerts and directions. They all pretty much happen on their own. Even directions, which work as a perfect complement to live navigation on the iPhone, launches and runs without me touching the watch. Perhaps there’s simply no need for an app home screen. I suggest replacing it with a better way of managing all those notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later this year or next, we will finally get a more radical Apple Watch redesign. I’m sure it will be beautiful and I will want it. In the meantime, though, it’s time for Apple to use its wearable market pole position to make some real market leadership moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Apple hits the gas by offering one new material and teen-and-culture-centric options, the only way they’ll see competition is in their rear-view mirror.\n",

      "\n",
      "For those of you who overzealously dry-clean your clothes, read the labels on your clothing first! If something says \"do not dry clean,\" it probably means the fabric has a special coating that can be removed by dry-cleaning solvents, aka could cause your clothes to pill down the road. If this is the case, Zoe says washing your clothes in the washer can actually help the fabrics stay more in tact than dry-cleaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 2: Fabric conditioner (aka fabric softener) isn't necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clothing conditioner will protect the fibers in your clothing from abrasive damage that happens when you wash or wear it. Just like how your hair frizzes without using hair conditioner, your clothes will fuzz without fabric conditioner. Adding fabric conditioner when washing mildly aged fabrics will actually smooth out the fibers in the fabric (which helps the color appear more vibrant) and improve the appearance of the clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 3: You should wash it after every time you wear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zoe says, \"Really pay attention to the needs of your life and also to your garments. I only clean my clothes when I feel that they need it. Over-washing your clothes or washing them when they're not actually dirty is a common mistake people make.\" Items like jeans and some shirts can be worn a few times without washing if they aren't stained, but certain things like underwear and workout clothes should be washed every time you wear them. That is, of course, unless you're just wearing yoga pants to watch TV, in which case you should wash them after two to three uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 4: If you wash your clothes in the washer, they will shrink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think a misconception sometimes is shrinking,\" Rachel says. \"And in fact, typically that's actually done in the dryer, not in the washing machine.\" If the label on your clothing says you can wash it, you're totally fine doing so. Just make sure to let it air-dry instead of tumble-drying to prevent shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 5: Hanging your clothes to dry is the best way to dry them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes drying your clothes on a hanger will actually cause damage,\" Rachel says. \"On a really fragile knit, it will leave a hanger mark on it, so a lot of times I just lie them flat or I'll put them outside to dry.\"\n",

      "Cashmere, polyester, and silk are commonly known as fabrics that should only be dry-cleaned, but these fabrics are actually fine to wash in the washer.

      "‘Empire’s Lee Daniels Says “Sorry” To Sean Penn; $10M Defamation Suit Ends\n",
      "Empire creator Lee Daniels will be making a deep pocket donation to a charity for Sean Penn as the Oscar winner pulls the plug on his $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Oscar nominee. No details of the size of the donation to Haitian relief were made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry that I have hurt you, Sean, and I apologize and retract my reckless statements about you,” Daniels said today in an apology that accompanies the donation and ends the nearly 9-month war of words and writs between the two. “How thoughtless of me. You are someone I consider a friend, a brilliant actor and true Hollywood legend and humanitarian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I accept Lee’s heartfelt apology and appreciate the sincerity with which it was delivered,” said Penn Wednesday in a statement of his own. “I also accept and appreciate his generous donation to J/P HRO, which will have a transformative effect on the lives of those we serve in Haiti.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial filing from Penn last September came not long after The Butler director in a Hollywood Reporter interview seemingly equated a double standard based on race out of the media response Empire star Terrence Howard had received from past run-ins with law and domestic violence accusations. Specifically, Daniels was nodding towards Penn’s behavior back in the 1980s, when the El Chapo interviewer was married to Madonna. He “ain’t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he’s some f*ckin’ demon,” Daniels said of Howard. “That’s a sign of the time, of race, of where we are right now in America.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Daniels addressed that matter directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I too have been the subject of false attacks by others, like those made here,” the Empire co-creator said. My most important role is as a father, and it is important to me that my children learn that it is wrong to reference gossip as fact, as I did here. That can be very damaging and hurtful.\n",

To further the point of the inclusion of the Material Girl backing her ex after years of rumors about abusive behavior by Penn in the relationship, Daniels’ filing asked “why neither Penn nor Madonna cried defamation and sued any of these prior publications.”\n",

      "Many PC users will have a ‘God Mode’ folder sitting on their desktop — it’s a neat Windows tweak that allows immediate access to a whole host of different controls that come in handy every now and again. However, new information from McAfee suggests that malware could be taking advantage of the same functionality.\n",

      "\n",
      "The malware installs itself in the AppData directory, creating a registry run key value so that it can survive a reboot. However, when users click on the folder created by Dynamer during this process, they’ll simply be redirected to an unrelated area of the control panel.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, Dynamer’s defenses are thankfully not completely impervious.

      "“It’s not about whether someone wants to marry me. It’s about whether I want that man in my life. It is my choice,” she continued. “It’s Kong men who should get real and stop blaming us women.”\n",

      "Women have long been the victims in an ongoing battle of the sexes in Hong Kong over the past three decades. Government statistics show that the number of men per 1,000 women dropped significantly from 1,087 in 1981 to 858 in 2014. A recent report revealed that last year there were over 1 million women aged 15 or above who had never been married, versus 962,700 men who hadn’t tied the knot—so technically, at least, 37,300 women are destined to remain single, and this doesn’t even factor in whether any of the 962,700 men are gay.\n",

So ladies, if you don’t want to end up as an old maid and die alone, you must hurry and “get real.” Don’t be picky and only go after men who have a “good package.” Cure your “princess syndrome” and stop being a spoiled brat. Don’t become one of those gold-digging, delusional Kong nui (a derogatory term for Hong Kong women) or a successful career woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stigma toward single women has become the central narrative of Hong Kong’s dating culture. The message to women is clear: Lower your expectations, even though you might deserve better. A column entitled “Hey sisters, get real or you will die alone” published on April 11 in EJ Insight is the latest, most offensive iteration of this message. (Yes, this is the one that offended my friend so much. While it appears to have been removed by the publisher, perhaps because of the number of complaints, a cached version is here.)\n",

      "The truth is, neither men nor women want to settle for less than what they want—and Hong Kong men and Hong Kong women seem to want different things.\n",

      "Hong Kong women have long been accused of being materialistic and eyeing money, but there is a reason for it. According to Fan Lai, a professional counselor who deals with relationship problems and family issues, few Hong Kong women are looking to marry a scion of a property tycoon. But, she added, many do aim for a man with a monthly income somewhere between HK$80,000 and HK$100,000 (roughly US$10,300 to US$12,900). That’s because they want a man who is financially independent and won’t turn around asking them for money or take advantage of them. “They are women who have a great education, a successful career, and a pretty face and just don’t want to settle for less,” Lai said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men who have a “good package” (this means, by the way, that they are physically attractive, with a sizable bank account and a promising career), she added, have complained to her that they are having greater difficulties in finding their Ms. Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They mind women who are too career-driven,” said Lai. “They don’t mind women who have a job, but when it comes to looking for a marriage partner, they want someone who is willing to stay at home and raise the family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is simply unrealistic. “How is it possible for women who are smart, ambitious, and independent to surrender their freedom and become a stay-at-home mum?” Lai questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick survey of my single female friends confirmed that they are unwilling to settle for less—and sadly Kong men are the worst to date, a conclusion that has nothing to do with their finances or physique.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kong men are not gentlemen at all,” said Lung. “If you go on a date, you pick up the girl, open the door for her, pick up the bill, and send her home. That’s very basic. And yet I’ve never seen a Kong man who has done it. But Western men do. I’m an international man eater, so I aim at a global market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-year-old university student Diana Lam described Kong men at her age as “toxic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They seem to be like ‘kidults.’ They are obsessed with video games and figurines. If a Kong man does not have a promising career or the ability to take care of a woman, Hong Kong women will not date him,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irene Fung, a 40-something businesswoman, said men who are still active in the dating market that she had encountered are usually incapable of genuine communication, have low standards for themselves, fear commitment, and lack self-confidence. “Once I dated a man who boasted how many properties he owned. It was such a turn-off,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kong men may also have little to offer in the bedroom. According to a 2014 survey released by the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong, nearly 60% of the 2,100 women aged between 21 and 40 reported at least one sexual problem that lasted over three months to one year—which could be attributed to a partners’ lack of expertise. Nearly 32% said they had no desire. A similar percentage said they had problems getting aroused. Some 40% said they fail to attain orgasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before accusing women of being unrealistic Kong nui and gold-diggers, Kong men should reflect on their shortcomings first,” Lung pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they do “settle down,” some Hong Kong men actually don’t. Fung said she has also encountered many married men who are wealthy and successful, looking for girlfriends behind the back of their wife. “They act as if they were single,” she said. “It is men who should get real and stop wasting our time. Being with a man is not a must. We’ve got better things to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued to sip my coffee in silence as Lung began munching on her green tea cheesecake, and I thought: As Hong Kong Film Awards chairman Derek Yee put it when he presented the best film award to dystopian film Ten Years, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”\n",

      "China is building floating nuclear power stations\n",
      "With 70 percent of our global real estate consisting of oceans and other bodies of water, one country with plenty of experience dealing with overcrowding is taking to the seas to build new power plants. According to new reports, China is working on floating nuclear power plants that will power its manmade chain of islands. China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation has been tasked with building a fleet of these structures in order to power the various radar systems, lighthouses, airfields, and other structures that currently reside upon the new islands in the South China Sea. And predictably, it’s no small undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liu Zhengguo, an executive at the Corporation, has been quoted as saying that “demand is pretty strong” for the nuclear stations, and Chinese media reported that the government has plans to build up to 20 of these mobile plants. While the concept of floating nuclear power stations isn’t particularly new (Russia recently began building them for use in the Arctic), China’s move marks the latest in its ambitious five-year plan. As the New York Times reports, the nation currently boasts building more nuclear power stations than any other country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nuclear reactors afloat would give the Chinese military sustainable energy sources to conduct their full panoply of operations, from air early warning and defenses and offensive fire control systems to anti-submarine operations and more,” Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, told the Chicago Tribune. And more concerning, perhaps, are the potential safety risks associated with such a large undertaking. “China has already done enough damage to the maritime environment by hastily building artificial islands and destroying irreplaceable coral reefs,” Cronin continued. “We do not need a nuclear accident in these importing fishing grounds and sea lanes.”\n",

      "My wife came out as transgender — here's what's changed for us since then\n",
      "Shutterstock / Anna Ismagilova\n",
      "\n",
      "When my fiancé came to me four months before our wedding and told me she was transgender, I had one of those movie moments where a character gets such jarring news that the audio goes completely silent, except for a weird buzzing noise and a few extremely muffled voices in the background. We spent three days talking, crying, and grieving. When I weathered the storm of the initial blow, I knew I had a lot of thinking and one very important decision to make — stay, or go? For me, the choice was relatively easy because I straight-up refused to live my life without her. Also, I’m bisexual, so it eventually all worked out. Nonetheless, her transition has changed many aspects of our lives. Its been hard. Some bad things have happened, as well as some really, really good things. Here are a few of those things:\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had to confront (and let go of) our previous straight privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, straight privilege. It’s totally a thing — one we didn’t think about much until we lost it. Before, we could walk around the mall, go out to eat, apply for apartments and loans, and be seen holding hands in public without a second thought, and without any fear of discrimination or hatefulness. Straight couples (typically) aren’t offensive to society just for existing. But the further along she got in her transition, the more and more we were seen in society as a lesbian couple. And, apparently, some people really hate lesbians. I will never forget one of the first times we stepped out together after she started living full-time as her true self. We were holding hands at the mall, and an older man gave us the dirtiest go-to-hell look. It took us both by surprise. It was then that we realized our place in society had shifted, that to some people we were now viewed as lesser. From now on, being out in the world wouldn’t be as safe or carefree as it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now have a better understanding of the world around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her coming out as trans forced me to do a lot of research. It forced me to open my eyes to the realities, both beautiful and dreadful, of the world around us. It led me to abandon a lot of old, out-dated ways of thinking I had before. It enlightened me and broadened my mind. I’m a different and better version of myself now, with a better relationship with the world I live in, and I love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was forced to let go of the life I had envisioned for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s safe to say that when your partner decides to transition, it throws your whole life for a loop. Suddenly, the ways and times you picture yourself buying a house, having children, even growing old, all change. This was something I struggled with in the beginning. I had a hard time picturing my future because I had no idea what to picture. Suddenly, I would be growing old with a woman instead of a man. It was about 2 months after she came out that I realized how foolish it is to ever think that life would cooperate with what I wanted. I knew I was in for mostly uncharted territory when I decided to stay, and once again, I was scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "We lost the support of some family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, it’s true, and it sucks. It happened, and it is what it is. Though I can say that the family I haven’t lost have come to be the most supportive, most loving, closest family I have, and they are more than enough to make up for what I lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve gained friends worthy of the finest jewels and gold…\n",
      "\n",
      "…or, you know, whatever it is that they’re into. This goes along with the family thing I mentioned above. My true friends came to the forefront with an unending wave of love and support that I will be forever indebted to them for. They were exactly who I needed at that time in my life. My relationships with them have transcended friendship into something entirely different. What’s the word? Family? Yeah, that’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found a new strength in myself that I never knew I had.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while there, my wife’s anxiety forced me into the lead role of household. I had to take over a lot of responsibilities that I had for so long been able to dodge because she was my safety net. Suddenly I found myself making the phone calls, running the errands, paying the bills, and shouldering a hefty load of my own anxiety — it was exhausting. I adopted a newfound no nonsense policy with my life, my problems, and my interactions with other people. Before, I used to avoid putting my adult hat on and dealing with my issues, but I can really take the reigns now. I don’t know if you guys know this, but its very refreshing to be in charge of your life. In the words of my girl Tina Fey, bitches get stuff done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now have a better relationship with my partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I are closer now than we have ever been. Before her coming out, we had weathered a multitude of hardships together already. We had been homeless, jobless, and we had also been the alternative — working jobs that made us absolutely miserable. We were old pros at sticking out the hard stuff. And though we bicker and have lots of other flaws, we have always been really good at truly turning toward each other in times of distress instead of taking it out on each other. We have grown even closer over the last couple years. Our roots have dug even deeper as we’ve leaned on each for support through this. The old adage doesn’t apply solely to individuals — what doesn’t kill your relationship will make it stronger, if you allow it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also have a better relationship with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife coming out has inadvertently caused me to look inward and examine several things about myself. I have gotten to know myself on a much deeper level. I’ve discovered things that I’m passionate about, like minimalism and intersectional feminism. I know what I need and want for my life, and have been able to start really working toward it. I know how to take care of myself mentally and spiritually now, which has lead to much more peace in my life. I no longer feel as though I need someone to point me in the right direction or to tell me what to do with my life, because now I know where to go on my own. I have found myself. And so far, I really like what I’ve found.\n",

      "Shutterstock / Franzi\n",
      "\n",
      "My little brother and I spent a long time hating each other. Most of that hate came from not understanding each other. Because of our different genders, we’d been raised differently — we’d been brought up to respect and value different things, we’d been forced into different roles, and we’d been taught to be different types of people. There was so much space between us, and such a deep and seemingly never-ending gap between our experiences. We thought about the world and ourselves within it so differently, and it seemed like we’d never find a middle ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we’ve gotten older, though, we’ve worked through it. I’ll never forget the first time he asked me about feminism. We were standing in the kitchen, just sort of laughing, dancing around, and eating microwavable french toast sticks, and he asked me about something he’d seen online. It was as if the moment I’d spent years preparing for had finally arrived — finally, finally, I’d get to dispel all of the disgusting meninist poison he’d been reading about and hearing from friends. Finally, I’d get to explain why him telling me to make him a sandwich and why his expecting me to clean up after him was sexist nonsense. We were finally taking a step toward where we needed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t talk about feminism all the time, but when we do, I’m prepared. There’s so much I hope he learns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feminism is valuable beyond what it has to offer him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something doesn’t need to benefit you specifically in order for it to be worth your time and energy. So when we talk about feminism, it’s important to frame things in such a way that we make sure boys and men know they, too, will benefit. But just like white people should combat racism regardless of how it impacts them, men should challenge sexism as they see it happening out in the world. I’m so happy that feminism will broaden his perspective, but I need him to care about the fact that it makes my life safer, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feminism isn’t just a stagnant identity — it’s a way of viewing the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many people are quick to say they are or aren’t feminists, which is fine, but not the only way to think about things. Feminism is a new lens through which we view the world. It’s questioning everything and thinking beyond the norms presented to us. If he’s going to practice feminism, he’s got to be ready to ask himself and his friends some really hard questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not easy to practice feminism, but it’s worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, feminism isn’t easy, and it’s not supposed to be. Feminism is about dismantling harmful structures and behaviors. There’s no guidebook, and no one way to go about it. But it’s so worth it, because we can’t live in a world where some people are literally more endangered than others simply because a part of the population refuses to give up power they don’t need.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re all different — and it’s a beautiful thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intersectional feminism is the idea that we are more than just a singular identity — so much shapes the way we move through the world, from gender to sexuality, class to ability. I hope my brother decides to make intersectional feminism a part of his practice, and to recognize the value of difference. We aren’t all the same. And it’s beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Listening is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being an ally to a cause beyond your own identity means learning when to speak up, when to amplify someone else’s voice, and when to simply listen. We can all be better allies by listening, and by doing the work it takes to figure out which action is best when you’re trying to show solidarity. Sometimes, it’s not about us — and that’s okay. If I go to an event for Muslim women, I’m going to show solidarity differently than if I were to go to an event for queer women, because I don’t identify as Muslim, but do identify as queer.

      "I was already practicing minimalism as a way of life and decided to take it to the extreme. I put my house up for rent, gave away most of my possessions, and moved into my Prius with my boyfriend. My goal was to live in it for two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing most people wonder about is where I slept. If you have ever done a road trip and slept in the driver's seat or passenger seat, you know it's not very comfortable. I knew that would not be a sustainable solution. So, I went to Walmart and bought a cheap egg-carton foam mattress and put it into my trunk. At night, I would fold down the back seats and lay the foam into the trunk. The mattress fit perfectly for two grown adults to sleep on comfortably. During the day, I rolled up the foam and folded the seats back up. No one was ever the wiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first night I slept in my car, I parked in a public park. That night, I was awoken to police rapping on my windows. Turns out you can't stay in a park's parking lot overnight. I drove into a quiet neighborhood and slept there instead. I knew I couldn't continue sleeping in neighborhoods, as that would probably arouse suspicion, so I did some Googling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that Walmart is cool with people sleeping in their cars in the parking lot. In fact, truckers and road-trippers do it all the time. I was a convert. (I still continue to sleep in Walmart parking lots when I am on a long drive.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But because I had the freedom to move my home every night, and I lived in beautiful Arizona, I would often go to nice hiking areas. After work, I would go to the mountains and hike for a few hours, then head back to my car for my nightly rest. I got to explore so much of the beauty that was around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hiking in Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was practicing minimalism, I couldn't resort to eating out all the time, so I hacked my car into having a kitchen. I bought a portable mini-refrigerator with a car adapter and plugged it into the cigarette lighter under the dashboard. The food stayed cold as long as I kept ice in the fridge, but the temperature would never be as cold as normal fridge, so the ice would only last 24 hours. Still, a bag of ice for $1 a day was way cheaper than rent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to my local REI store and bought a bunch of camping gear for cooking. I got a mini-stove that I could light with a lighter, a folding plate, folding cup, sporks, and a folding wash basin. I was all set to cook, eat, and clean up.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my lunch break at work, I would drive to the local park (no cops during the day!) and cook my food at a picnic table. In the evening, I would cook dinner wherever I happened to be — usually somewhere out in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also learned the art of thermos cooking. Turns out, if you put boiling water into a thermos with oats, in the morning you'll have oatmeal. You can also use rice and lentils and have lunch ready the next day. There are so many delicious, healthy recipes that you can cook in a thermos!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was fortunate that my job had showers, so I could bathe there; but if I showered there every day, it would seem weird. I was very open about my new adventure with my colleagues and boss, and everyone was super-supportive, but I didn't want to draw too much attention, so I looked for alternative locations to wash up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, the gym near my job had showers, too, so I would go there on occasion. On the weekends, I did longer travels and could easily find big truck stops. You know the kind that have mini-malls of several restaurants and stores? They always have showers available that you can rent for a few bucks. They even provide free towels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also bought a solar shower to use. It was basically a black rubber bag that heated up the water with the sun, but it was always just easier to go to the gym or truck stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "For laundry, I just went to the laundromat once a week. I kept my clothes in the compartment in my trunk that was meant for a spare tire. I also kept a large plastic bin with more clothes, costume jewelry, and makeup in the back seat. At night, when the seats folded down for my bed, the bin went in the passenger seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The craziest part of my escapade was that I was doing all of this with my then-boyfriend. Let me tell you, living in a super-cozy situation with another human being can cause serious cabin fever. You very quickly learn to hash things out, and get over things. It really taught me a lot about communication and teamwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it was the two of us and not just me, we couldn't just sit in the car every night. We began to have evening adventures. Every night, we would go explore the area surrounding us. We went to all these little towns and learned their histories, and found amazing hiking trails and saw nature like we never had before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll never forget one night we drove on this mountain for what seemed like forever, and all of a sudden, we came upon a magnificent church. It was so old and so beautiful. There was nobody there, but it was open. We went inside and stayed for a while. It was very peaceful and magical.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the weekends, we went for longer drives into neighboring states. I saw so much of New Mexico, California, Nevada, and Texas. My Prius was economized for fuel consumption, so gas was cheap. And with sleeping in my car, there were no hotel or restaurant bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to save a ton of money while living out of my car. Not only did I no longer have a mortgage payment, but because I had rented out my place, I was making a little profit. By being forced to live on the absolute essentials, I didn't go shopping for needless things. And even with cooking, I only bought a few items instead of having a big pantry with numerous items and expensive condiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I learned to not be so attached to all my possessions. I had forced myself to give away most of my closet (and my 30-pair shoe collection!) before moving into my car. After living in it for a month, I realized I needed only three pairs of shoes: one for work, one for hiking, and one for going out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of my two-month stint, I thought about continuing to live out of my car and looked at purchasing a mini-trailer that would attach via a hitch. However, I relocated to Iowa, and I didn't think living out my car in freezing temperatures would be such a good idea. In the Arizona heat, I didn't have to worry about the cold. For the heat, I bought a loose piece of mesh (like the ones that are on home windows) from Home Depot and used magnets on the inside and outside of my car to hold the mesh together. With the window rolled down, and a big piece of mesh cut to fit the window held by magnets, I had perfect airflow. And no bugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living out of my car was an amazing experiment. I learned how to be resourceful, saved a ton of money, and was able to let go of my attachment to possessions. Going on mini-vacations and becoming a better partner were unexpected consequences that have created lasting memories and lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I live in a fairly large home surrounded by things, and I look at my trusty Prius and think What if I let go of it all again? A good purging may be in order. Who know what adventures await?\n",

      "The Scott Walker Project Is Almost Complete\n",
      "MADISON, WISCONSIN—Five years ago, as part of the uprising here against Governor Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin, a group of people gathered in the rotunda of the state capitol building to sing songs of protest. Since then, those people, who became known as the Solidarity Singers, have been rousted, busted, fined $200 apiece, and subjected to the delicately named \"pain compliance\" techniques taught to capitol police forces these days. They've been targeted by silly laws—including one prohibiting the playing of musical instruments in the building—and they've beaten those laws in court. This is because the Wisconsin state constitution gives its citizens a right to assemble in their capitol even beyond that guaranteed by the federal charter. That's part of the state's legacy of progressive politics that Walker has deliberately tried to destroy, and that he's gone a long way toward wrecking already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2011, every Monday through Friday, they gather and they sing. On Friday, they sing outside, which means that they can bring their instruments. A guitar. Assorted percussion. A fiddle. And a testifying trombone. Motorists passing by in the street still honk their support. The songs are old, their lyrics refashioned to apply to the circumstances in Wisconsin. (For me, I'm sorry they changed \"Which Side Are You On?\" in such a way as to remove the denunciation that immortalized Harlan County sheriff J.H. Blair.) They are cheerful, happy people. And there is something indomitable about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The thing that keeps us going is that relationships are formed,\" said Rebecca Alwin, who has been singing with the group almost from the very beginning. \"There are people who have gotten to know each other. One of the absolutes about this group is that we are welcoming. We accept people if they come once a month, once a year, or if they're much more regular. And it's the amazing joy of singing together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They need all the optimism their music can muster because, truth be told, the project that Walker launched on behalf of his patrons and in the face of massive protests in 2011 is remarkably close to completion. The project was meant to show that, with the right amount of will, big money, and political finagling, radical conservative politics could succeed even in the place where progressive politics virtually had been invented at the turn of the last century. Wisconsin is now a right-to-work state. It has a restrictive voter-suppression law. Its commitment to the relationship between the state's universities and good government—the central tenet of The Wisconsin Idea—has just about been shredded, as have the long-standing institutions dedicated to good government. The state's long-standing commitment to environmental protection has been utterly reversed. Walker—and his pet legislature—have managed to turn every part of the government into purely partisan instruments dedicated to purely partisan purposes. If Walker manages to get his protégé, Rebecca Bradley, elected to a full term on the state Supreme Court, then the takeover largely will be complete.\n",

      "\"We don't know if we're going to win this [state Supreme Court] race with Joanne Kloppenberg,\" said Rebecca Alwin, before rejoining the other singers for a rousing rendition of Will The Circle Be Unbroken? \"When you have right on your side, the people who are tight-fisted trying to hold onto power for the few can't stand up to the power of the many. I have confidence in that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That Wisconsin once again has become vital to the nominating process in both parties, albeit for radically different reasons, brings a welcome dose of historical reality to the process. In a year in which the word \"populism\" is tossed around with promiscuous abandon, this is the place where modern populism, expressed by the democratizing progressive power of good government, was born. This has been where those achievements have been under the most vigorous assault. The energy that once brought 100,000 people to the capitol lawn is now being directed at keeping Bradley off the bench. The odds are no better than 50-50.\n",

      "\n",
      "I kept praying for a long, long, time—to a suffering child, it seemed like an eternity, but I knew God sometimes tested people’s faith. God also punished people, so I tried to remember if I had done something bad that I deserved to be punished for, but I couldn’t think of anything. Nobody had ever done anything bad enough to deserve what was happening to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only time I ever talked the monster out of hurting me was the night before Christmas Eve, and I said, “Please, no. Santa will see.” Many times he promised me he wouldn’t hurt me anymore, and I thought, maybe, that God had finally answered my prayers. But the monster always did it again, and I finally decided that God wasn’t going to help. What kind of God wouldn’t help someone like me?\n",
      "\n",
      "After a whole lot of suffering and misery, I finally figured it out: There was no God. Everybody had made a terrible mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I decided it was up to me, I told another family member what was happening and hoped that if she called the police fast, the monster wouldn’t have time to kill my mom. She called the police, and when they arrested him, he had illegal guns in his truck, and a collection of girls’ panties (they were trophies from his other victims, I learned later).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had two grown brothers from my mom’s first marriage, and someone in my family said the monster would be lucky if they didn’t kill him. I was disappointed when they didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turned out, he was a bigamist who had a wife in another state, so his marriage to my mom wasn’t legal. The police took custody of me that day and brought in a lady—probably a child psychologist—who interviewed me before they gave me back to my mom. When she got me back, Mom told me I was lucky they didn’t take me away for good, and she wanted to know why I didn’t tell her about the abuse instead of telling the other family member. I didn’t have an answer for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monster was violent and abusive toward her, too, but I could tell she loved him. To this day, I haven’t forgiven her for her poor judgment and I doubt I ever will.\n",
      "\n",
      "We lived in a small town, and everybody knew what had happened. I didn’t care because I was too young to be ashamed, and it wasn't happening anymore. I was delivered from hell, as far as I was concerned. I was blissfully happy because the monster was in jail, and my family told me they would never let him out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a trial, and I had to recount the whole story, everything that had happened, so they could record it on tape for the judge. By that time, I was six years old, but they still had to teach me the proper words for private parts so my testimony would be legal. My mom and I were both sent to court-ordered counseling. I was never told how long he would be in prison, but for years afterward, we got an annual letter from the parole board, asking if we thought he should stay in prison. The answer was always yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sent cards and letters and even a decorated T-shirt, and my mother stupidly gave these things to me. I wish she had thrown them in the trash. I think she still loved him for a long time, but she eventually married a terrific man, a friend of the family, who turned out to be a shitty husband, but he was a great father to me. He once told me he didn’t believe a word I’d said about the abuse, and that telling stories like that could ruin a man’s life. He was afraid I would tell lies about him, so he didn’t touch me at all—not a hug, not a pat on the head—and that suited me just fine. I didn’t want anybody to touch me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I am a grown woman, happily married to a wonderful man who has helped me overcome my past, with kids of my own. My mother is not part of our lives. I still have occasional flashbacks of the abuse, and I doubt I will ever get completely past it, but that misery has the capacity to consume my life. I have plenty of good memories that I choose to think about instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot understand how people think it’s a good idea to teach a helpless child that God, whose existence is entirely unproven, has the capacity to help them or save them from actual harm. I had no doubt that God was real and that he would help, and because I had faith, I suffered for a lot longer than I would have if I'd have known I was on my own. I wasted so much pain and suffering on faith. Children who have cancer and other terrible circumstances are no doubt praying, just as I did, for help that will never come. It is extraordinarily cruel to teach children to have faith, when it is possible to teach them instead to rely on themselves and on real things.\n",
      "\n",
      "My children’s grandparents are vaguely religious, and my mother-in-law in particular is talking about taking my kids to church, but I won’t ever let that happen. Religious people don’t realize that some people have very good reasons for hating religion. Some religious people might be interested in helping me find God again, and to them, I would say, “Fuck off. You’ve done enough damage already.”\n",

      "Netflix quietly rolled out HDR on a show you probably aren’t watching\n",
      "We’ve known for a while now that HDR was coming to Netflix sometime this year, but it seems that moment has slipped in quietly, like a stealthy teenager after a long night of partying. Owners of TVs from multiple brands have begun to notice that they can already watch Netflix content in HDR – for one specific show, that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Stream your favorite TV shows and movies with Amazon Fire TV\n",
      "\n",
      "The first season of the Netflix original series Marco Polo has been available in HDR for days, as was first spotted by FlatpanelsHD. Netflix has yet to officially announce the new capability, but has confirmed to Digital Trends that HDR, which is often referred to as the secret sauce that makes 4K content all the more brilliant, is indeed live and ready to stream on its historical drama and will soon make its appearance on other titles as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As of mid-March, we have been providing both Dolby Vision and HDR10 streams to supported TVs, giving Netflix members an even more visually stunning experience,” a Netflix representative told Digital Trends. “Marco Polo Season 1 is available now, with more titles — including Marvel’s Daredevil — coming soon.” It should be easy enough to find new content when it’s added, since the Ultra HD 4K badge will apparently be replaced with a simple HDR badge on supported series to help them stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix says that since every 4K Ultra HD TV released in 2016 from a major manufacturer will be compatible with either Dolby Vision or HDR10, it’s only a matter of time until its HDR streams are available en masse. Vizio and LG currently have Dolby Vision enabled, while TVs from other companies like Sony either provide HDR10 out of the gate, or can be updated with support, as that company’s 2015 models received last fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marco Polo may seem an odd choice as it’s not exactly one of Netflix’s hottest titles, but the high-budget period drama was shot natively in HDR, and Netflix says it had “great enthusiasm from the creative team” making it an easy first choice. Season two of the show will also be available with HDR support fairly soon, with the official release slated for June of this year. Netflix has yet to disclose when other titles such as Daredevil will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the current hype around televisions focuses on 4K resolution, but as far as Netflix is concerned, HDR is much more important. “I think HDR is more visibly different than 4K,” Netflix chief product office Neil Hunt told Digital Trends in February. “Over the past 15 years, we have had plenty of increments of pixels on the screen, and from what we saw with digital cameras, pixel count eventually stopped being interesting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix isn’t alone in the HDR game — Amazon has been showing originals like Mozart in the Jungle and Red Oaks in HDR since June of 2015. Our experience with Amazon’s version so far has been a mixed bag. Artifacts, possibly due to compression (or simply the limitations of high-speed internet at present), make it hard to fully appreciate the richer contrast and wider color gamut HDR can offer. We’re hoping the Netflix version can improve on the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, while HDR support’s arrival in more TVs means that more content will start to be shot for HDR from the beginning, it’s going to be a slower process for older shows and movies. Hunt compares adding HDR to older content to colorizing a black and white movie — a lot of effort is needed, but it may still be worth it for a grander picture in the end. Until then, for those who already own or are thinking about purchasing a new 4K Ultra HD TV with HDR support, it may be time to give Marco Polo a shot.\n",

Although the Gripen is not being sold like a Saab car, creating a video born to go viral sends a message that Saab Defence thinks they've created a plane that will grab eyeballs in defense departments worldwide. (They've got a history of pushing hard: in 1999, the company was investigated after accusations of bribery in South Africa—which ended up buying 26 Gripens.)\n",
      "\n",
      "With the new Gripens, Saab has created remarkable machines. The new Gripen D, a two seater, has a combat turnaround time of ten minutes and a total load capacity of over 11,000 pounds. The company already has long ties in Austria and Brazil, and has only worked at deepening those connections. 350 Brazilians moved to Sweden for the project, which has been documented in a web series produced by Saab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gripen has been in development for nearly 30 years. Two non-fatal crashes in 1987 and 1993 and a far-left party reluctant to spend on its military meant its funding has been passed by narrow margins in the Swedish parliament. Despite that, the Gripen is a remarkable machine: light and maneuverable, with massive lift thanks to its delta wings and a canard (the short forewing) control system allowing it to hit angles of attack at 70 to 80 degrees. It also has an open-source, fully programmable and integrated avionics system, giving it a bit more flexibility for export nations to alter the aircraft as they see it. Whether they will be able to make a dent in a global market dominated by F-16s, F-18s, and the Russian-built Su-27 Flanker is a more difficult question. Regardless,even if they stay niche Saab has already proven that they can win the war on social media. This video is gorgeous.\n",

      "Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and Cirque du Soleil all canceled performances in North Carolina to protest the state’s anti-LGBT law. For Cyndi Lauper, the show will go on, but the singer announced all profits from her July 4 concert in Raleigh will go to support the fight against HB2.\n",

      "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court did a thing that my every instinct tells me that the Supreme Court shouldn't have to do. But apparently, the United States, a country with a Bill of Rights that you can buy at the gift shoppe on your way out, needed clarification on the subject of whether or not you can pauperize a criminal defendant as a way of making sure this person's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a sad and tattered joke.\n",
      "\n",

      "The crucial point, Justice Breyer wrote, was that the right to counsel is a fundamental constitutional guarantee, while the government's interest in recovering money is merely important. \"Despite their importance, compared to the right to counsel of choice, these interests would seem to lie somewhat further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system,\" he wrote.\n",

      "This takes the pruning shears to a lot of the fig leaves prosecutors have used to cover some really shifty practices, particularly in drug cases. In addition, it's a none-too-subtle whack at the whole system of asset forfeiture which has been rife with corruption at the local and federal level for years. As Breyer also wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"…relevant legal tradition offers virtually no significant support for the Government's position. Rather, tradition argues to the contrary. Describing the 18th century English legal world (which recognized only a limited right to counsel), Blackstone wrote that \"only\" those \"goods and chattels\" that \"a man has at the time of conviction shall be forfeited.\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 388 (1765) (emphasis added); see 1 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 737 (1816) (\"[T]he party indicted may sell any of [his property]...to assist him in preparing for his defense on the trial\"). Describing the common law as understood in 19th century America (which recognized a broader right to counsel), Justice Story wrote: \"It is well known, that at the common law, in many cases of felonies, the party forfeited his goods and chattels to the crown. The forfeiture...was a part, or at least a consequence, of the judgment of conviction. It is plain from this statement, that no right to the goods and chattels of the felon could be acquired by the crown by the mere commission of the offense; but the right attached only by the conviction of the offender...In the contemplation of the common law, the offender's right was not divested until the conviction.\"\n",

      "And, while the plaintiff in this case clearly did not need to avail herself of our cash-strapped public-defender programs, this decision has ramifications there as well. In his opinion, Justice Breyer argued that impoverishing the plaintiff—essentially, forcing her to rely on the public-defender systems—was a Sixth Amendment violation in and of itself. It's not a huge leap from there to the position that underfunding those systems also violates that same amendment. As it happens, in his dissent, Anthony Kennedy, ol' Weathervane himself, made precisely that point.\n",

      "\n",
      "They settle for what works, and it’s working. It works for them, and that’s why you don’t hear me knocking them. You don’t hear me hating, saying ‘this is that’ or ‘this shouldn’t be’ or ‘you shouldn’t do this’ or ‘you shouldn’t do that,’ because it actually works for them. If it works, it works. I’m part of a different culture, a different wave of music, and that wave was, you know, Jay Z, Nas, Biggie. At that time, it was all about being the best. I mean, I’m quoted for saying I’m the best rapper alive. Nowadays, nobody… they ain’t trying to be the best rapper, or the best at anything. They’re just trying to be them and do what the other people say is OK. I’m not a part of that culture and I’m damn sure happy I’m not.\n",

      "It is getting a little bit unseemly to hear Democratic analysts and liberal voices in the punditariat latching on one of the more desperate hopes of Republicans who would rather not run against Hillary Rodham Clinton—namely, that she's going to be questioned by the FBI and subsequently indicted for something in connection with the great email nothingburger. Today's entrant is the increasingly hilarious H.A. Goodman, whose devotion to the notion that The Great Bernie Wave Is Just Around The Corner has become positively Millerite in its fervor. (Scott at Lawyers, Guns, and Money is H.A.'s most diligent chronicler.) Anyway, on Wednesday, after Sanders won a substantial victory at the polls in Wisconsin, and a considerably less substantial one as far as the delegate count goes, H.A. pronounced his heart lightened by the prospect of HRC getting tangled up with the Feds.\n",

      "Before we get into the nub of the gist here, let's take a look at Mr. Sievert's author's note at the end of the column.\n",

      "Well, alright then. But he did work in the DOJ under both Republicans and Democrats, and he seems to be more of a national security fetishist than anything else—so we'll give him a pass for the moment as regards his present gig. What Sievert is arguing is that HRC could still be indicted even if the information found in her emails was never classified at all, or classified ex post facto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The applicable statute, 18 USC793, however, does not even once mention the word \"classified.\" The focus is on \"information respecting the national defense\" that potentially \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.\" 793 (f) specifically makes it a crime for anyone \"entrusted with … any document ... or information relating to the national defense … through gross negligence (to permit) the same to be removed from its proper place of custody.\" A jury (not a Democrat or Republican political administration) is, of course, the best body to determine gross negligence on the facts of this case.\n",

(Sievert pretty much admits this is the case by the end of his column, although he finds the whole thing deplorable.) Honestly, HRC raised $29 million in March and she's coming into a couple of wheelhouse primaries, and she's still ahead anyway. My world should collapse so handsomely.\n",

For instance, Amphenol, a hinge maker located in the United States, has joined Apple’s supply chain to serve up this specific part, taking business away from Jarllytec and Shin Zu Shing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news arrives by way of DigiTimes, which reports that Apple’s new MacBooks won’t appear until the second half of 2016. Amphenol is reportedly creating hinges through a special metal injection molding process to help the MacBooks achieve an ultra-thin form factor. This is the same company that provides hinges for Microsoft’s Surface Pro line of products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources have also told DigiTimes that battery pack suppliers Simplo Technology and Dynapack International Technology, both of which are located in Taiwan, are facing competition from China-based Desay and Sunwoda Electronics. The two Chinese companies provide batteries for Apple’s iPhone devices, and have submitted MacBook battery packs for testing. So far Apple has not placed MacBook battery orders with the two Chinese companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "DigiTimes originally reported back in March that Apple would start shipping 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks at the end of the second quarter of 2016. These two models will supposedly be thinner than the existing MacBook Air while sharing a design similar to current 12-inch Retina MacBooks. Unnamed sources added that notebook makers Asus, Dell, and Lenovo are also launching ultra-thin solutions in the same time frame to compete with Apple’s new lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "9to5Mac adds to the MacBook rumor mill, reporting that the new devices will likely only feature USB Type-C ports on both sides to keep the super-slim form factor. They also may arrive in gold and rose gold color options, making them super attractive in addition to being highly thin. Branding is uncertain for now, as they could replace the current MacBook Pros or be released as larger versions of the Retina MacBook.\n",
      "\n",
      "A previous report supplied by Economic Daily News back in November 2015 claimed that the new MacBook Air would be a major upgrade from the current model, featuring Internet component changes and a thinner, lighter design. Apple is also supposedly pondering 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the MacBook Air, and could very well ditch the 11-inch model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report went on to claim that the next-generation MacBook Air would sport new cooling modules, a new chassis, new batteries, and so on. Apple will reportedly stay with the same supply chain manufacturers, including Quanta, although the new DigiTimes report says otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "DigiTimes previously said that Apple shipped 20.38 million Mac-based products during 2015, representing solid growth over 2014’s sales numbers. The site quoted sources saying that despite a “weakening” demand for notebooks, Apple should see increased growth in that sector during 2016 thanks to the updated MacBook and MacBook Air solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new MacBook and MacBook Air devices are expected to be revealed during WWDC 2016 this June, and will likely start shipping units in the second half of 2016 as DigiTimes’ sources indicated. That could very well mean July, so you may not need to wait too long to upgrade your current MacBook or MacBook Air. Of course, given that everything mentioned here is pure rumor, we’ll just have to wait and see what WWDC 2016 has in store for Apple customers.\n",

      "If you’re a New Yorker who thinks you’ve been overpaying at the pharmacy, your complaints may have merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walgreen Co.—which operates hundreds of Walgreens and Duane Reade stores across the state—will pay the state $500,000 amid a probe that found shops routinely charged customers different prices at the register than what was listed on shelves and in ads, according to a settlement announced by the New York State Attorney General.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, the discrepancy was a result of price tags on shelves being posted after the advertised price had expired. The probe by the attorney general’s office, which began in 2014, also found that Walgreens referred to some products as “Smart Buy” or “Great Buy” even when the advertised price was the same as the original retail price. Additionally, it unveiled that both Walgreens and Duane Reade advertised some “Last Chance” or “Clearance” items that remained at a reduced price for as long as eight to 10 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When consumers purchase products at retail stores in New York, they should be able to rely on the prices displayed in advertisements and on shelf tags and not have to worry about being overcharged when they get to the register,” Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in the statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems weren’t limited to pricing issues, however. The probe found that Walgreens implied that customers would receive an immediate cash discount for certain purchases, when in reality, they would be tacked onto future purchases. Members of Walgreens’ loyalty program also received inconsistent information about when or how they could redeem the points they had earned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walgreens did not admit to nor deny the attorney general’s claims. However, it agreed to regularly review all price advertisements to ensure they accurately reflect what consumers are being told, as well as revise its employee training information.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tired of your time on Earth? Elon Musk may have a solution. The ambitious SpaceX founder and CEO is known for his — literally — out-of-this-world ideas, and the latest is a city on Mars. In a surprise appearance at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center last week, the entrepreneur laid bare his plans to colonize the Red Planet. Well, not completely. Rather, Musk teased the existence of a full-blown plan, which he will elucidate upon further in September, when he gives a much-anticipated talk at the International Aeronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Musk’s initial topic of discussion centered around rockets and his Falcon 9, things took an interesting turn toward the end of his press conference, during which he spoke about the possibility of a SpaceX “City on Mars.” Musk is known for being well ahead of the curve when it comes to many of his concepts, a point he referenced during the discussion. “I think it’s going to sound pretty crazy,” Musk told the audience. “So it should be at least entertaining.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To many, Mars seems like the next logical frontier — a new sort of Manifest Destiny for earthlings to conquer. “It’s a fundamental decision we have to make as a civilization,” Musk recently told a reporter in Hong Kong. “Mars is the next, natural step. In fact, it’s the only planet we really have a shot at establishing a self-sustaining city on.” That said, this is all mostly talk — at least until September.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as far as how we’re going to get to Mars, Musk certainly seems to have figured it out. Reusable rockets, the executive says, are the key to future space travel. Calling reusability the “fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space,” Musk has certainly proven the viability of his designs. He’s met with quite a bit of success in his latest rocket launches and landings, and with a track record like his, a city on Mars may not be that crazy of an idea after all.\n",

      "In some areas, bike thieves circle city blocks like vultures. They swoop down on bikes left outside, giving them the once-over to see how secure they are, their tools clicking like talons. If you’ve backed the Hexlox Kickstarter campaign, then you might watch a thief poke at your bike in confusion trying to figure out how to turn the bolts for your saddle or stem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hexlox are a little magnetic nubbins that lock inside standard Hex or Allen bolts, blocking wrenches and making the bolt impossible to turn. Hexlox come in a variety of sizes, and open and close using a unique magnetic key. They come in a variety of sizes to fit any bolt on your bike, allowing you to “lock” things that are usually hard to secure, like your bars or even your dropout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: See here for the latest bikes on the market\n",
      "\n",
      "Other security systems usually involve replacing the bolt itself, or using some sort of cable-tie method that can be defeated by a determined thief. Hexlox don’t require swapping any parts except for quick-release skewers — but more on that later. Pick the Hexlox up with the key, put it in the bolt, give it a quarter turn, and that’s it. The bolt is locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Keys are so 2015, but Kwikset’s keyless smart lock could be the wave of the future\n",
      "\n",
      "Leave it on until you need to swap something. Made of 316 Stainless Steel, Hexlox are weatherproof, so they won’t rust in place. Adding Hexlox to pre-existing bolts means no worrying about thieves cannibalizing parts of your bike, and no carrying extra cables to secure your saddle or wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "These even let you secure your headset, stem, and bars, which is otherwise tricky to do. One older technique was like a basic concept for Hexlox: ball bearings superglued into a bolt (superglue can easily be dissolved with acetone). Obviously Hexlox can’t be flicked out of their bolt the way a determined thief could do to something that’s only glued down. Hexlox literally lock, and the key is unique, so you don’t have to worry that another Hexlox owner might turn thief on you and grab your gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only catch here is that they obviously don’t work on quick release skewers (which have a lever at one end rather than an Allen wrench slot). The Hexlox Company designed a set of hex skewers that they are offering as part of some reward bundles, but if you already have a set of hex skewers for your wheels and saddle, they’ll work just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hexlox smashed its modest funding goal of a little over $22,300, so people must see the benefit: They’re unobtrusive, cost-conscious security for your bike, and revolutionary as far as fork and headset security is concerned. The campaign had a $100,000 stretch goal for colored caps for the wheel skewers, so they will hopefully be added to options for everyone else after June 2016 when they ship to backers.\n",

Last week, female airline attendants argued they shouldn’t be forced to cover their hair while in the Islamic Republic, as required by law. Air France navigated that blip by agreeing to let female staffers who refused to cover skip those flights. Now, a gay Air France steward is demanding a similar diversion for fear of being persecuted.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Sure, our sexuality isn’t written on our passports and it doesn’t change the way we work as a crew,” Laurent wrote. “But it is inconceivable to force someone to go to a country where his kind are condemned for who they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Homosexuality is considered a crime in some 75 countries — close to half the world.

      "\n",
      "In an emailed statement to Foreign Policy, Air France said it has “not had any issues in recent years” in the 17 countries it directly serves that also have restrictive laws against homosexuality.\n",

      "“By its nature, flight crews’ work requires them to serve countries whose cultures and regulations are very different to our own, and Air France management carries out constant monitoring to ensure that all members of its flight crews can perform their duties in the safest possible conditions,” the statement read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran holds the world record for most executions per capita, but mostly for drug convictions; the number of people killed for being gay is unknown. Some in Iran’s gay community say the state has been far more lenient since President Hassan Rouhani’s election in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air France debacle is the latest in a series of cultural clashes between secular France and Islamic Iran that have served as stumbling blocks in the two countries’ fledgling relationship.

      "Want to shape the future of PlayStation Vue? Try canceling your subscription\n",
      "Last month, Sony’s PlayStation Vue Internet TV streaming service finally became available nationwide — something cord-cutters located outside of a handful of major metropolitan areas had been anxiously awaiting since the service’s introduction last year. While the service is now available to all, it’s still got a long way to go, and now it seems we might have an idea as to where it is headed next.\n",
      "\n",
      "PlayStation Vue customers trying to cancel their subscription are presented with a survey asking what might change their mind, and this survey was recently shared on Reddit, and spotted by Exstreamist. Some of the options are commonly seen on exit surveys, but others could point to planned additions to the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, customers are asked if lowering the subscription price by $5, $10, or $15 dollars would be enough to change their mind. The service currently starts at either $30 or $40 per month, depending on whether or not the customer is located in an area where local channels are offered. The lower-priced Core Slim package was introduced last month when the service expanded nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more interesting questions come in the form of whether additional channels would be enough to woo customers. League sports networks like the NFL Network, local sports networks like MSG, and Spanish-language networks are listed as options, while A&E, History Channel, Lifetime, and FYI are presented together as a single option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, ABC is also an option, but ABC, ESPN, Disney and more were added to the channel lineup shortly ahead of the nationwide launch. This is no guarantee, but it could point to Sony already being in talks to add the other programming options listed in the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "One factor that the survey doesn’t address could be one of the most important, at least according to several Reddit commenters: availability. PlayStation Vue is available on PS4 and PS3 consoles, Amazon Fire TV devices, ChromeCast, and iOS devices. This leaves out Apple TV users, but also Roku users who already have access to another similar service.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the long period when PlayStation Vue was only available in limited cities, Sling TV offered fewer channels, but at least was able to offer them everywhere, and on more devices, including the Roku. The contractual deals required to offer so many channels on PlayStation Vue may have hamstrung Sony, but if device compatibility remains limited, the service could have a hard time increasing its user base.\n",

They couldn't confirm the belief that his range spanned four octaves, but they did find a number of interesting insights into his vocals. Though he was widely known as a tenor, the researchers show that he was likely a baritone. This comes from an analysis of six interviews that revealed a a median speaking fundamental frequency of 117.3 Hz.\n",
      "\n",
      "After analyzing a singer imitating Mercury's vocal performances, researchers also found that he used subharmonics, a style \"seen in a more extreme way in Tuvan throat singing where not only the vocal folds vibrate, but also a pair of tissue structures called ventricular folds, which are not normally used for speaking or classical singing,\" the study noted. Mercury also sang with an irregular vibrato. A normal vibrato lands between 5.4 Hz and 6.9 Hz, while Mercury's was at 7.04 Hz. Comparing it to legendary opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, researchers said that Mercury was vibrating something in his throat that Pavarotti wasn't even using.\n",

      "The DEA Just Approved a Way to Smoke Marijuana Legally for the First Time\n",
      "The unofficial pot-smoking holiday of April 20 may be over, but marijuana advocates got another reason to celebrate on Thursday. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for the first time approved smoking marijuana as legitimate medical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEA green-lit a clinical trial of smoked marijuana for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in American military veterans, a spokesperson for the government agency confirmed to Fortune. While other trials have studied the medical benefits of marijuana and cannabis extracts like cannabidiol, this is the first time regulators have allowed testing of the marijuana plant itself for the purpose of developing it into a legal medical drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), an organization researching legal uses for marijuana and other mind-altering drugs, is conducting the trial, which is funded by a $2.2 million grant from Colorado’s state health department. MAPS had worked for more than five years to obtain clearance from regulators to use pot in the trial; while it received the OK from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 and from the U.S. Public Health Service in 2014, it still had to wait for the DEA’s approval in order to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEA’s decision marks a major shift in policy for the agency, which has long resisted the legalization of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes, and has also denied the medicinal potential of pot. Just six months ago in November, DEA head Chuck Rosenberg dismissed the concept of medical marijuana as “a joke,” according to CBS News. “What really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal—because it’s not,” he said. “If you talk about smoking the leaf of marijuana—which is what people are talking about when they talk about medicinal marijuana—it has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, however, the DEA has apparently had a change of heart, indicating earlier this month that it is considering whether to reclassify marijuana from its current category—the same one as heroin and LSD—into a lower one alongside less dangerous drugs. So far, DEA has not rejected any research studies involving marijuana products that met FDA standards, the agency’s spokesperson added. To date, 24 states have legalized the use of medical marijuana, but the DEA still considers weed illegal on a federal level.\n",

      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for tonight's episode of Arrow, titled \"Eleven Fifty-Nine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During a screening of tonight's harrowing episode of Arrow earlier this week, a number of reporters had the opportunity to see who was in the grave before it aired tonight on The CW.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was for those in the room, as it was for many watching, a pretty emotional hour of television.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question out of the box, perhaps unsurprisingly, was \"Why Laurel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive producer Marc Guggenheim answered, but one of the first things he wanted to impress upon people was that the decision to kill off Laurel -- Oliver's love interest in the comics -- has nothing to do with their desire to prop up Oliver's TV romance with Felicity Smoak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Obviously Arrow is always a show that's evolving, it's always a show where you know, every character arguably except for the Arrow is fair game,\" Guggenheim said. \"And you know we started off this year with the promise of a death, and when we sort of worked our way through our various different creative choices, we realized that you know, the thing that will give us the most pop going into the end of the season and into next season unfortunately would be Laurel, and we knew by the way, we knew that it would enrage a lot of people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know, you know we're not immune to the you know, shipping, and we're not immune to the internet controversy, but...when I say immune, we're not blind to it, but you know we've never made decisions on the show creatively because of the Internet, and you know, one of the you know, one of the things we knew people were going to think is, 'Oh well, in the season were Oliver and Felicity get engaged, and Laurel dies, that's clearly making a choice about who's going to end up with who,' and truth be told, we sort of, we told the Laurel, Oliver romance story in Season One,\" Guggenheim continued. \"We told that story. We never really thought about going back to it, so the shipping the was not an element, it was not a factor for us, and we recognize that that upsets a lot of fans, particularly the comic books fans who, in the comics, Dinah Lance and Oliver Queen are in very ... depending on which version of the character you like, are in a romance together in very iterations, and that to some people is considered canonical and iconic, and we respect that, but at the same time we've always you know, made know bones about the fact that we are telling our own version of the Green Arrow mythos and you know, the Green Arrow has had so many different interpretations and blackened areas, and had so many different interpretations over the years that we never felt you know beholden to one particular interpretation, and this is our interpretation, like it or not, and I recognize that there are plenty of people up and down my Twitter feed who do not like it. Totally respect that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he said, it's a creative decision. That Arrow now exists in a world of time-travel, flashbacks, spinoffs, alternate Earths, and Lazarus Pits makes it a little easier to say good-bye to a beloved character or a fan-favorite cast member...but at the end of the day it's still mostly how a loss affects the rest of the world of the show that determines who gets the ax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's never been just about one or two different particular fan bases,\" Guggenheim said. \"We make the creative choices, you know, we feel benefit the show as a whole, and the story that we're telling overall.\"\n",

      "Like many women, Leslie Mait had a feeling about Hillary Clinton. The 55-year-old from Glen Ellyn, Ill., had followed her career as first lady, a U.S. senator, and secretary of state for more than twenty years. \"Something in her experience just [made me think], 'I think she can do it in spite of everything everyone says.'\" But unlike most Clinton supporters, Mait is a Republican who has never before voted for a Democrat for president.\n",

Nearly half of female GOP primary voters said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump, according to a NBC/WSJ poll last month, while only 40 percent of male GOP primary voters said the same. And with Trump's chances of securing the nomination looking better and better, this is proving to be a trying time for Republican women.\n",

      "Many women—particularly those who have watched her marriage flounder, her struggles to raise a daughter under media scrutiny, and her climb to the top of the political ladder against the odds—feel a kinship with Clinton that has less to do with politics and more do to with her biography. Asma Hasan, a Republican, considers herself part of an exclusive sisterhood that counts Clinton as its most distinguished member. She started at Wellesley College in 1993, the same year Clinton, a 1969 graduate of the college, became first lady. \"I kind of grew up with Hillary always in the background of my adult life,\" the Denver-based attorney and author tells me. \"She's always had an influence on me and how I see the world.\"\n",

And I think that one way to deal with that it is to try to support each other and mentor each other, encourage each other, give each other advice,\" she says. \"There are people out there that will not vote for her because she's female―because of sexism, that is perhaps latent and hard to identify. ...I'm a woman first before I'm a Republican,\" Hasan says. \"And I feel like having a female president is an important goal for women.

Last week, former first lady Laura Bush hinted that she'd rather see Clinton in the Oval Office than Trump. And Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey, told Bloomberg's With All Due Respect last month that she would take four more years of a Clinton administration over \"the kind of damage I think Donald Trump could do to this country, to its reputation, to the people of this country.\"\n",

      "China Successfully Tests Hypersonic Weapon System\n",
      "China has conducted a test of its new hypersonic weapon. The test is the seventh successful test of the so-called DF-ZF, the Washington Free Beacon reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test was carried out from the Wuzhai missile test center in central China. Past DF-ZF weapons—previously called WU-14 by the Pentagon—were aimed at inner Mongolia. The test was the second major missile test in two weeks. On April 12th, a DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile was launched into the South China Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "The DF-ZF is what is known as a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGF). The DF-ZF is thought to be launched by a DF-21 intermediate range ballistic missile. Unlike a typical ballistic missile warhead however, a hypersonic glide vehicle stops short of entering space and glides through the atmosphere at speeds of between 4,000 and 7,000 miles an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "A weapon traveling at such blistering speeds could hit any place on Earth in less than an hour. The unique flight profile of HGVs—not quite a ballistic missile and not quite a regular air-launched missile—combined with its extremely high speed, makes them difficult to intercept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Free Beacon emphasizes Chinese HGVs as a first strike weapon. While theoretically possible, China's strategic nuclear arsenal consists of between 200 to 300 weapons—nowhere near enough to destroy America's nuclear arsenal first even if HGVs were used to \"kick in the door\" and destroy America's ground-based missile interceptors based in Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "An operational Chinese hypersonic weapon will likely be a conventional—not nuclear—one. A HGV weapon could, for example, target Taiwanese air bases and air defenses, destroying them in minutes and helping China gain air superiority over the breakaway island. Such a weapon could even be used to target individual ships at sea, much like the DF-21D and DF-26 \"carrier killer\" ballistic missiles .\n",
      "\n",
      "China is not alone in developing hypersonic weapons. The U.S. Air Force anticipates it will have hypersonic weapons operational by the 2020s , likely based on experimental vehicles such as the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 and the X-51 WaveRider . There are reports China is particularly concerned about U.S. development of hypersonics as they could be used to target China's modest nuclear arsenal without the need for the U.S. to \"go nuclear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia is also developing hypersonic weapons, having conducted a test just two weeks ago . The Russian weapon used an SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missile as a booster and the test was reportedly successful. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy anticipates putting the Zircon anti-ship missile into production in 2018, which will be capable of speeds of up to 3,800 to 4,600 miles an hour.\n",

      "Top aides to GOP front-runner Donald Trump argued their candidate is “projecting an image” when he makes controversial statements and that he is “evolving” as he hopes to secure the GOP nomination. At a meeting of Republican officials in Florida, Trump convention manager Paul Manafort outlined why his boss’ public persona would soften if he’s a general election candidate, saying Trump aides are working to fix his “personality negatives.” Manafort argued those are more easily solvable than Hillary Clinton‘s “character negatives,” adding Clinton is “going to hate” Trump by the time the general election is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting represented an effort to reassure the Republican National Committee that Trump can win in November in hopes to bring about acceptance of Trump as the party’s nominee, rather than see a bitter convention fight in Cleveland. Manafort added that Trump would commit whatever funds necessary to win the White House—a significant concern of the RNC which has struggled with raising cash without a presumptive nominee—while another Trump aide, political director Rick Wiley, argued Trump would expand the general election map. The meeting allayed some of the fears of RNC members, who are hovering between resignation and denial over the current state of the GOP race, but many are still hoping for a contested convention to bring about an alternative.\n",

      "\n",
      "Idris Elba is in four major studio films this year, but you won’t see his face in any of them. Three of those high-profile jobs are voice roles: In addition to playing Chief Bogo in Zootopia and Shere Khan in The Jungle Book, Elba has a supporting part in Pixar’s upcoming Finding Dory. His only live-action role in the lot is playing the villainous Krall in Star Trek Beyond, where he’s buried under so many facial prosthetics that he’s more than unrecognizable — he’s a different color entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t fault Disney for wanting to cast Elba in all of those cartoons: The man’s got one of the best voices in cinema, rich and insinuating. And now that Elba has become something of a sci-fi staple in films like Prometheus and Pacific Rim, perhaps it was inevitable that he’d don makeup for a franchise like Star Trek. But as one of the few black leading men in Hollywood, Elba means something. So what does it say when we see so little of him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could call all these castings a fluke. I worry they’re not. Look at Lupita Nyong’o, whose most notable roles since winning the Oscar for 12 Years a Slave have been playing the orange alien Maz Kanata in Star Wars and the white wolf Raksha in The Jungle Book. In this summer’s video-game adaptation Warcraft, Paula Patton is slathered in green paint as the half-human, half-orc Garona, which makes me wonder if she consulted Zoe Saldana for advice before taking the role: After all, Saldana has already played green in Guardians of the Galaxy and blue in Avatar. (It’s become so common for Saldana to play a different color on film that they even gave her another skin tone for the controversial clusterfuck Nina and thought nothing of it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t see Leonardo DiCaprio, Sandra Bullock, and Tom Cruise painting their faces to win roles, but this color-changing gambit has practically become required of black dramatic actors who want to appear in big-budget movies. Of our A-list movie stars, the only white one regularly tinting her skin is Jennifer Lawrence, who signed a three-film contract to play Mystique in the X-Men films well before she was an Oscar-winning superstar, and whose latest go-round in the role is her least blue yet. Fox was savvy to put Lawrence’s famous white face front and center for X-Men: Apocalypse, since they now know it’s a face that sells movie tickets and magazines. So, too, could Lupita Nyong’o’s, yet since her Oscar win, no white director has cast her in a live-action role that lets her live in her own black skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it’s just another symptom of Hollywood’s current failure when it comes to actors of color: If movie studios continue to treat black faces as an onscreen rarity, it’s not much of a jump for those same stars to then be deemed exotic-looking and alien. Elba and Saldana have both played extraterrestrials several times and if Nyong’o does sign on to the sci-fi thriller Intelligent Life, as has been rumored, then only one of the four films she’s shot since 12 Years a Slave will have given her a human role to play (that would be Mira Nair’s upcoming, fact-based Queen of Katwe, which required a black woman to lead it). Patton’s casting as a half-orc in Warcraft strikes me as particularly pernicious: Only in Hollywood would someone think that the beautiful Patton’s mixed-race features could contain a dollop of monstrousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, when these are the only big roles available, who can blame these actors for taking them? When black actors want to play human beings or lead a film themselves, they’re continually forced to work outside the major studio system or in independent film. Aside from Saldana’s recurring role as Uhura in the Star Trek films — a part that has traditionally always gone to a black actress — the last time she was able to appear in her own skin in a big-budget studio film was 2011’s Colombiana. Elba’s talent has been apparent for ages, but outside of his negligible cameos in Marvel movies, he’s spent the last three years since Pacific Rim working almost exclusively in independent movies or smaller films for specialty distributors. I’m encouraged that Elba was just cast as the lead in The Dark Tower — a part not written for a black man — and I hope this can be the bulwark that lets him resemble himself onscreen from now on. Look at Will Smith, who minted his movie stardom 20 years ago after a string of lead roles that made use of his charisma, talent, and winning face. Why is Smith, whose unobscured face will be on display in this summer’s Suicide Squad, treated by Hollywood as a rare fluke, rather than as an example of what can happen for this new vanguard of dramatic black talent if we provide the right opportunities for them?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of this past year’s second straight #oscarssowhite debacle, I saw people like Spike Lee calling on Hollywood to adopt some version of the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates for the league’s top jobs. Whether or not that’s realistic, it’s not unreasonable to expect studios that use black actors’ prodigious talent in their animated films to pony up live-action roles for those thespians, too. And if they’re not going to paint Margot Robbie purple, maybe they should stop doing it to Zoe Saldana. The black actors I named in this article are some of Hollywood’s most talented and beautiful, and they deserve to be seen for countless reasons, not least because in this screwed-up world, representation must continually be fought for. Idris, Lupita, Paula, and Zoe have faces that matter. Let us see them.\n",

      "Sarah Palin Weirdly Attacks Bill Nye: ‘As Much A Scientist As I Am’\n",
      "With just one week to go before some 130 countries sign a landmark agreement to tackle climate change at the United Nations, a group of roughly 150 naysayers gathered Thursday in Congress’s Rayburn Building. They were there to see and discuss “Climate Hustle,” a documentary that purports to bust the “myths and hype” and expose man-made global warming to be a hoax.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the bigger draw at the event may have been one of the panelists, Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska who remains a star, albeit a controversial one, in conservative circles. The overwhelmingly sympathetic crowd—this was invitation only—murmured in agreement and chuckled at her anecdotes about liberal “fear-mongering.” Palin wasted no time, attacking “Bill Nye the Science Guy.” (Nye, a science educator, is the host of a popular children’s science show.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” Palin said. “He’s a kids’ show actor, he’s not a scientist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(She made the remark after a brief clip was shown of Nye, in which he said, good-naturedly, that he hoped climate change deniers will be rejected by the American people.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Palin bemoaned the fact that children are being taught to embrace the premise that humans are causing climate change. She added this is why “it’s so important for parents to be a greater influence than the schools.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Palin was joined in the panel discussion by David Legates, described as a “the former Delaware state climatologist,” and Marc Morano, who runs ClimateDepot.com, for the Committee For a Constructive Tomorrow (known as CFACT), co-producer and funder of the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics contend CFACT is a shill for Big Oil, though Morano claims that 85 percent of CFACTS funding comes from “individual donors.” (Mother Jones has included it among “The Dirty Dozen of Climate Change Denial.”) The screening was held in the meeting room of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, whose chairman Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tx), endorses the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moderator, conservative activist Brent Bozell, lobbed softballs at Palin. Palin’s environmental stances have included calls for more drilling in the Arctic Ocean and, she noted at the event, keeping polar bears off the threatened species list.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want life to be better for mankind,” Palin explained, “and that takes developing our natural resources.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion was being filmed to accompany Climate Hustle when it’s screened for one day at some 400 cinemas around the country on May 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie itself is a long 75 minutes, featuring various scientists who’ve either never believed in manmade global warming, or have gone rogue—disputing what is near consensus among scientists and therefore becoming virtual pariahs in their field. While the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is largely caused by the estimated 2 billion tons of CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels and other human activities, Climate Hustle, which has an oddly jaunty tone, scoffs at such alarmism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate Hustle was cowritten and narrated by Morano, a former spokesman for the most best-known climate-change denier in the senate, Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a reception after the screening, which Palin didn’t attend, Morano said he felt an urgency to produce this film, now that “President Obama has bypassed Congress” with environmental legislation, and “little rules are slipping in through the EPA.” The film is meant to be “a reality check,” he explained, adding that he’s already working on a sequel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: An earlier version incorrectly stated the number of theaters showing the film. The correct number is 400. This story also was updated to include mention of the clip of Bill Nye.\n",

      "You probably get that it's hard to have just one Starburst, M&M, spoonful of your favorite ice cream, etc. Sugary treats trigger our brain's reward system, flooding our neurons with the pleasure chemical dopamine. We feel awesome as a result but we instantly want more, as dopamine also gives rise to craving. And this is why some scientists now consider sugar to be a legitimately addictive substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "But is sugar really on par with cigarettes, alcohol, or cocaine? One study freshly published in the journal PLOS ONE offers further evidence that sugar can mess with our brains just as severely as hardcore drugs do. But the same study also suggests that interventions designed to treat substance dependence could help sugar addicts break free from being hooked on sweets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers from Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, heightened a family of lab rats' sugar cravings by granting them access to a constant supply of super-sweet water for four weeks. These rats developed a tolerance for the sweet water during this time frame, meaning they needed more and more of it to feel satisfied. (Tolerance is a hallmark of addiction, hence why the researchers wanted to build it in their subjects.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Once hooked on the sugar water, some rats were injected with a drug designed to treat nicotine addiction in humans called varenicline. Others were left to continue bingeing. Rats given varenicline were able to walk away from the sugar water feeder far more often — and easily — than their cousins who received no intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were also, not surprisingly, able to shed added pounds gained during the weeks they had access to the rodent equivalent of a dessert buffet. This led the researchers to conclude that yes, sugar addiction is legit but it might be stoppable with drugs designed to curb cravings for other addictive substances. \"Further studies are required,\" the study authors said in a press release, \"but our results do suggest that current FDA-approved nAChR drugs [i.e., varenicline] may represent a novel new treatment strategy to tackle the obesity epidemic.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The study , published in the journal Science on Thursday, analyzed results from probes placed in the forebrains of five Australian bearded dragons that monitored the reptiles' brain activity as they slept. The researchers found that the dragons cycled through REM and slow-wave sleep patterns, just like mammals and birds do (although with different frequency and timing of the cycles).\n",

      "The results also show that these sleep cycles evolved much earlier than previously thought, possibly back to the emergence of amniotes, the study says. Amniotes are the common ancestor shared by mammals, birds and reptiles and existed about 300 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs, too, may have gone through REM and slow-wave sleep cycles.\n",

      "First Class Cabins Are Setting Off Air Rage, Study Finds\n",
      "If you’ve found yourself bristling when settling into your seat on an airplane, particularly if you’re back in coach, there’s a reason. A new study by researchers at the University of Toronto and Harvard Business School suggest that the cabin becomes a microcosm of a class-based society and that physical and situational inequality sets off antisocial behavior, more common known as air rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katherine DeCelles from the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management and Michael Norton from Harvard analyzed an international airline’s database of thousands of incident reports, involving millions of flights. It found that cases of “air rage” are more frequent on flights when there’s a first class cabin. And the unruly and abusive behavior is more likely to occur in both first class and economy class when economy passengers have to walk through the first class section while boarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking that humbling walk past those already seated in first class becomes a clear reinforcement of their “relatively disadvantaged status,” the authors wrote, which can “prompt negative emotions and aggressive [behavior].” And the antisocial behavior can come from the haves as well as the have-nots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost 84% of the incidents occurred in economy class, while 15% happened in first class. Men were involved in more than three times the number of incidents than women, and usually the target was a flight attendant, not other passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately the shrinking room in passenger seats, especially in economy, has been a source of complaints, and flight attendants have suggested it is leading to more air rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this new study identifies the physical layout and boarding procedures that trigger air rage. The study also found that air rage among first class passengers increased when there were more first class seats, larger cabins, and delayed flights. The incidents in first class were more likely to involve a passenger being belligerent or angry. DeCelles calls this “entitled reactions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In economy class, the incidents tended to emotional outbursts, the result of stress, fear or frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data available to the researchers did not include how many people were in each section of the plane, so it is impossible to know for certain whether people in economy are actually more likely to undergo air rage than those in first class or if the greater number of cases was due to there being more people in economy than first class. In addition, it may be that more planes have forward entry than middle, so comparing air rage rates by absolute numbers based on how people board could also be misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "With first class cabins getting more lush and larger, the risk of air rage could grow. “As both inequality and class-based airplane seating continue to rise, incidents of air rage may similarly climb in frequency,” the authors note.\n",

      "Tom Brady, the best player of his generation, has been suspended for four games, for something the league never proved he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s not good. But put yourself in Goodell’s spot for a moment. As SI and ESPN both laid out last September, the vast majority of the NFL does not trust the Patriots. This started with Spygate, which Goodell completely botched, but it went beyond that. Many powerful people in the NFL think the Patriots cheat. They wanted blood. As a pragmatic matter, Goodell had to give them some.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution for Goodell was so simple. After commissioning the Wells Report, he could have fined the Patriots $1 million and taken away a 2016 first-round pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this punishment sounds familiar, it should. I stole it right from Roger Goodell. That was part of his punishment for Deflategate. It is why there are 31 picks in the first round of this week’s Biggest NFL Draft Ever instead of 32.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a serious punishment by any standard except the one he imposed. If Goodell had left it at that, what would the various constituencies have said?\n",
      "\n",
      "• SI VAULT: Why the Patriots trust backup QB Jimmy Garoppolo\n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-Patriots forces in the NFL would have wanted more—let’s face it, they always want more—but they would have to admit this was severe. The NFL has only taken away a first-round pick once before: for Spygate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patriots owners Robert and Jonathan Kraft would have been furious. But what could they do about it? They would have privately seethed, and they may have done an interview or two with friendly Boston media outlets to explain that people are just bitter about New England’s four Super Bowl titles and delicious clam chowder. But there was no way they would not have taken the league to court. They would have accepted the penalties as the cost of doing business in a league where business is very, very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patriots fans would complain, but fans everywhere complain.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this would have been over last spring. There would have been no court battle, no ugly public back and forth, and no ongoing discussion about whether the league was being fair to Brady.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a bonus, there was a perfectly logical defense for this kind of decision. The Patriots had been caught cheating before, so they had lost the benefit of the doubt. And no matter what they say, there was evidence against them. Locker room attendant Jim McNally, who called himself “the Deflator,” illegally took the balls into a bathroom before the 2015 AFC Championship Game, then denied taking them into the bathroom, then admitted he did but said he used the urinal. There is no urinal. There was more, but I’ve already gotten to the urinal part, which is my favorite. So let’s just move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Goodell did not have was much evidence against Tom Brady. Sure, a reasonable person could surmise that if the Patriots deflated footballs, Brady approved it, and may even have requested it. But you don't suspend people based on what you surmise. So many of the arguments against Brady were specious. He gave memorabilia to the perpetrators as a bribe (even though every star gives memorabilia to co-workers). He spent an unusual amount of time talking to equipment assistant John Jastremski after the story broke, a sign of a cover-up (even though Brady may have just been checking on a guy who was not used to being in the middle of a media storm.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, forget what you think of the Patriots. If you think they are guilty and Brady was the prime culprit, forget that. If you think the Ideal Gas Law proves this was all nonsense, forget that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodell felt like he had to do something. The solution was right there for him. He could have said he didn’t know who ordered the deflation, so he was not going to punish any individuals, but he had come down harshly on the team. And that would have been the end of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, this story keeps going and going. Goodell wins in court, but he did not win. The Patriots obviously did not win either. The rest of the league didn’t even really win, because the Patriots kept winning games and this story has made the whole league look silly. When the story of Deflategate is finally, mercifully told, there will be only two groups of people who really won: Lawyers, and sports commentators.\n",

      "This is why the water on your nightstand tastes weird in the morning\n",
      "Shutterstock\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re among the majority of people who’ve been told to “drink more water,” then you probably have a glass filled with H20 on your nightstand right now. Since this is one of the first places you see before you fall asleep and after you wake up, nightstand water can effortlessly remind you to drink more fluids. However… such fluids don’t always taste great after sitting out overnight and Science is to blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to water that seems stale, SciShow reports that several factors may be involved. Firstly, it’s important to note that water isn’t only made up of H20 molecules – it also contains plenty of other molecules and ions that can alter the taste of plain, old water.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Entertainment / giphy.com\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, carbon dioxide can become one with your glass of water. We exhale this gas and it’s also what makes our beloved oceans more acidic. Interestingly enough, according to Smithsonian, carbon dioxide can have the same effect on our water-filled cups (because, if you really think about it, a glass of water is like a super mini ocean). When C02 from the surrounding air makes its way into our water, it blends with H20 molecules to form carbonic acid. This makes the water more acidic and, thus, less refreshing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from C02 entering the water, another gas leaving the water may also change the taste of our thirst-quenching drink. Since the EPA reports that many water treatment facilities add compounds containing chlorine to our water – seeing that this element is an expert at destroying bacteria and viruses – it can impact the taste of the water we get out of our faucet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we’re used to drinking water with a hint of chlorine, we can begin to associate chlorine with clean water. Over time, as water sits out in the open air, the chlorine will evaporate into the air. Then, when we go to drink this water, it doesn’t taste as fresh as it did before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we have temperature. When you pour yourself a cool glass of water and then drink it, the cold temperature can suppress your sense of taste. In other words, when you drink cold water, you aren’t always tasting all the understated flavors that are a part of it. Alternatively, there’s warm water, which has faster moving molecules that amplify what you taste with your taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, despite all these changes that happen to our water without us even knowing it, Dr. Kellogg Schwab told Time that water sitting out overnight isn’t bad for us. It may not taste like it deserves five stars, but it shouldn’t harm you in any way.\n",

That has its advantages considering how large 4K titles are (around 40GBs or more). However, to use Ultra, you need to utilize a newer Sony TV. Sony announced it would also make Ultra available for PC streaming on machines running Intel’s seventh-generation chip sometime in 2017, but we have yet to confirm the support has launched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important distinction between Ultra and Playstation Video is that, until recently, Ultra titles were only available for purchase, though the service has since opened for rentals. Many titles support HDR, but selections are effectively limited to Sony Pictures movies and TV shows. Sony films on your UltraViolet catalog can also be streamed on Ultra, and Sony will even let users upgrade Sony UltraViolet titles to 4K “for a special discounted price.” But frankly, you will be hard-pressed to find virtually anyone using Ultra, as its many restrictions make it one of the least enticing services on the list, and one of the least battle-tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost: Rental start at $5 (varies by title) and $20 to $25 for purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Requirements: Recommended minimum 10 Mbps download speeds; select Ultra HD TVs, PC, or 4K-capable Roku models hooked up to 4K Ultra HD TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "This service was originally known has M-Go, before Fandango purchased and rebranded it. The service offers 4K UHD movies for either purchase or rental, as well as a hearty selection of films that are also offered with HDR. Unlike some other services, FandangoNow has a list on its website that makes it easy to see which movies are available with HDR, and what is only available in standard 4K.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Google has its own 4K streaming device, the Chromecast Ultra. While the device will support some of the previously mentioned services out of the box, the Google Play Store has a selection of 4K movies available for rental or purchase. This service isn’t just relegated to the Chromecast Ultra, however. Any 4K capable device that supports Google Play — such as the Roku Ultra or Nvidia Shield — can access these movies via the Google Play app.\n",

      "Cost: $45 to $50 per month.\n",

      "\n",
      "In July 2018, FuboTV became the first live TV streaming service to offer programming in 4K with HDR. At first the only games to take advantage of this increased visual fidelity were 2018 World Cup matches, but now the service is streaming some NCAA football games in 4K as well. While 4K content is still fairly limited, this means that the service is equipped to show both Fox and FS1 in 4K with HDR10, so if nothing else, expect to see more live sports making use of these technologies moving forward. The service has also said it will begin offering some entertainment programming (not just sports) in 4K with HDR this fall.\n",

      "Donald Trump is already in hot water with women, 73% of whom disapprove of the GOP frontrunner according to recent polls. Now, he’s poised to infuriate another massive voting block: parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Republican candidate has increasingly been portraying himself as a family man, often joined on the stump by his three eldest children—Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric—his comments in series of past interviews reveal retrograde ideas about fatherhood that are out of step with today’s America, where both parents work in nearly half of all two-parent households.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buzzfeed took a look back at a series of interviews from 2003 to 2007, in which Trump held forth on fatherhood, taking care of the kids, and parental gender roles. The real estate mogul, who is not exactly known for being consistent, stayed on message about parenthood throughout: Dads supply the money, moms do everything else.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trump doesn’t change diapers…\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t do that,” Trump said on the Opie and Anthony show in 2005. “There’s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there’s a lot of husbands that listen to that… I’m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don’t. It’s just not for me.”\n",

      "…or really do anything hands-on to care for his kids.\n",

      "“I mean, I won’t do anything to take care of them. I’ll supply funds and she’ll take care of the kids. It’s not like I’m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park,” Trump said in a 2005 interview with Howard Stern. “Marla used to say, ‘I can’t believe you’re not walking Tiffany down the street,’ you know in a carriage. Right, I’m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn’t work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not just babies that Trump avoids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 2007 interview, Trump told Stern about his relationship with Tiffany, his daughter with Marla Marples. Trump said that Tiffany visits him, “You know for about an hour, ‘Hi dad,’ Hi Tiff, I love you Tiff.’ She’s a great kid,” says Trump, who tells Stern that Tiffany’s a smart girl—something he knows because he “glances” at her report cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps he’s trying to patch things up with Tiffany after his comments on a previous Howard Stern Show?\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to Stern in 2003, Trump said he married Maples because she got pregnant with Tiffany. “At the time it was like, ‘Excuse me, what happened?” Trump said. “And then I said, ‘Well, what are we going to do about this?'”\n",

      "Bill O'Reilly sat down with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show last night, and, as usual in these encounters, he stayed cool, calm, and collected. OK, obviously not. To be fair, the discussion was mostly relaxed as it wound through the primaries (they're over) and O'Reilly's cozy relationship with Donald Trump (something about milkshakes). But then it was time to discuss why, exactly, the Orange One is increasingly close to becoming the most powerful person in the world.

      "Conservatives, O'Reilly told Colbert, feel they're losing The Culture War—the battle for America's soul that began in the '90s—to Colbertian progressives. Conservatives feel the Republican establishment has deserted them in that fight, so they've turned to the guy whose opposition to gay marriage is largely inconsistent and who doesn't care if Caitlyn Jenner uses the women's bathrooms at his tower. I guess Bill O meant the immigration stuff?\n",
      "\n",
      "The real consequences of political correctness, O'Reilly explained, are far more grave. When Colbert asked for an example, the Fox host cited Kate Steinle's death at the hands of an illegal immigrant in San Francisco last year, and Congress' subsequent refusal to pass \"Kate's Law,\" which would impose stiff penalties on people who are deported and re-enter the country. This was just as much Republicans' fault, apparently, which is why people like Trump now.

      "It only took a few vigorous hand motions to demonstrate that political correctness is at the root of all the country's problems, and that spineless Republicans have allowed it to fester. This was not the best moment of the interview (that was O'Reilly's \"I'm not arrogant enough to say this person or that person isn't qualified\") but it was almost as entertaining as the first meeting between these two.

      "Let’s get to the point: the first trailer for Toho’s reboot of the Godzilla franchise, Godzilla Resurgence, dropped earlier today and in a word, it’s breathtaking. Showcasing a back to basics approach to Kaiju films, it draws heavily from the 1954 original, released when Japan was still recovering from World War II and inspired by the devastation of the war’s final days. Here, we see that earlier film’s depiction of remote, godlike terror with modern effects and techniques. Sure, the monster still looks like a man in a suit and yet, it’s genuinely terrifying. It helps, of course, that the the scale of the attack is both distant and personal, as shown by Godzilla towering over the city he’s plodding through, and the focus on on-the-ground devastation. Watch the clip above now.\n",

Co-directed by Neon Genesis Evangelion co-creator Hideaki Anno and Gamera storyboard artist Shinji Higuchi from a script by Hideaki, it hits Japanese theaters July 29.\n",

      "On the heels of a seriously heartbreaking story about a 3-month-old who died on her first day of daycare, a woman named Deborah Stokes is making headlines for operating a string of \"disastrous\" Christian daycares all over southern Alabama for a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stokes began opening daycares 14 years ago in Saraland, Alabama, according to Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. Just weeks into her new career, authorities discovered she was keeping kids in a building that didn't meet basic health and safety standards. Stokes was arrested for child endangerment, criminally charged, and later convicted. She also was banned from operating a daycare for two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon enough, she was back at it. She opened a daycare in a decrepit warehouse that one worker described as a \"house out of a horror movie.\" Another was next to a porn store. Parents and workers have reported Stokes for abuse and neglect — hitting kids with flyswatters, locking them in closets, rapping them with rulers, and failing to pay employees, according to police reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course police, county health officials, city council members, building inspectors, and tons of former employees and upset parents have tried to take action, but they can't seem to stop Stokes. When she's forced to close one of her daycares, she just opens another in a neighboring town. This is all possible, because daycares that identify as religious, like Stokes's, are exempt from certain licensing rules and don't require any real government oversight in 16 states, including Alabama.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2006, the Alabama Department of Human Resources didn't verify the safety requirements of one of her daycares in Mobile, because they trusted that churches would tell the truth about complying with the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within months, a county health inspector named Alice Rollins was responding to parents' complaints and found babies lying in carriers on the floor because Stokes hadn't bought enough cribs. Rollins wrote in her notes that one infant had been neglected for so long that \"urine had soaked through its outer garment as it sat on the carpet\" and electrical outlets in the kitchen didn't have childproof plugs or cover plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Reveal reports that they could find no evidence that Stokes's church — which she founded — holds services or performs outreach. The site's investigation also found at least 80 daycare operators who suddenly decided to identify as religious after regulators tried to shut them down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Stokes is running a church daycare called Little Nemo's, next to an auto repair shop, that is at least her 12th operation. All she had to do to open her doors was tell regulators was that her daycare was \"an integral part\" of her church.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is hope for parents who are appalled by what Stokes and similar daycare owners have been using religion to circumvent regulations. Yesterday, Alabama lawmaker Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham introduced a bill to overturn the state's religious exemption for faith-based daycares, citing the Reveal investigation's findings.\n",

      "Here’s why Ford isn’t building an EV with a 200-mile range\n",
      "Recent advances in battery technology make it possible for electric vehicles to drive farther on a single charge than ever before. However, Ford has revealed that it’s not interested in building a battery-powered car that offers 200 miles of driving range.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 200-mile EV would give Ford a product to compete against the hotly anticipated 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, and the upcoming second generation of the Nissan Leaf. Executives explained that they’ve ruled out building such a vehicle for the time being because achieving 200 miles on a single charge would require a battery pack that’s big, heavy, and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Ford’s next all-electric car is a comprehensively revised version of the Focus Electric. It will arrive this fall with a 100-mile range, about 25 more than the model that’s currently found in showrooms. That’s not much on paper, and certainly not when the Bolt promises to drive for at least 200 miles between plug-ins, but Ford believes it’s enough to satisfy the needs of most buyers who are in the market for a compact electric car.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think right now with the launch of the Focus Electric at 100 miles, it is going to satisfy a big chunk of the population. It’s going to be really affordable and a step up from where we are now,” affirmed Kevin Layden, Ford’s director of electrification programs and engineering, in an interview with trade journal Automotive News.\n",

      "Tesla Unveils a Factory to Change the World\n",
      "Few people have the ability to get a room full of people pumped up—and so overcome with excitement that they shout out affirmations of \"Yes!\" and \"woohoo!\"—about manufacturing. But that's what happened Friday night as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and co-founder and CTO JB Straubel addressed the company's biggest fans at a \"grand opening\" of its massive, and still-under-construction battery factory outside Reno, Nevada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invite-only event, parts of which were broadcast live July 29, followed a press tour earlier this week at the massive complex being built in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm really excited about revitalizing manufacturing,\" Musk said to the crowd of VIPs, customers, and some of the company's earliest investors. \"It needs love, and we're going to give it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gigafactory is critically important for the company; it's the cornerstone to all of what Tesla ( tsla ) hopes to achieve: To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. The factory is expected to reduce the per-kilowatt-hour cost of Tesla lithium-ion battery packs by more than 30%, which will in turn drive down the cost for its electric vehicles. Without the factory, Tesla's mass-market Model 3 won't be possible—at least not for $35,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, a lot is riding on the success of the gigafactory. In a video of the grand opening event, which you can check out below, the excitement and intensity of Musk, Straubel, and the crowd is palpable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factory, which will cost at least $5 billion to build, was only 14% completed when Fortune reporter Katie Fehrenbacher got a tour of the facility on Tuesday. But even at just one-seventh complete, the factory and grounds still seemed monstrous.\n",
      "\n",
      "And big it will be. The footprint of the completed factory is 6 million square feet, a size that could accommodate 93 Boeing 747 jets, or—according to Musk—50 billion hamsters. That's a lot of hamsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elon Musk's Mention of a 90-Year-Old Book Broke the Internet\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's about making enough electric cars, enough stationary battery packs that it actually moves the needle from a global carbon production perspective—that it actually does really change the world,\" Musk said, explaining the purpose behind the gigafactory. \"It has to be big because the world is big.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2018, the factory will hit its initial goal of producing 50 gigawatt hours of battery packs a year, the amount required to make about 500,000 electric cars annually, not to mention its energy storage product Powerwall. When the factory is fully built out, it will have the ability to make 150 gigawatt hours of battery packs a year, enough for 1.5 million electric vehicles, according to Musk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There just wasn't enough factory capacity anywhere else in the world,\" said Straubel, explaining why the company decided to build the gigafactory. \"We didn't have an option.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's not just about building a big factory. The art and science of manufacturing is how to thoughtfully design and lay out every detail and component within it to be able to make more goods as efficiently and cheaply as possible without making compromises on quality. Other companies, notably Toyota, have been working towards that efficiency sweet spot for decades. What makes the Tesla gigafactory special is the sheer size of the building and the company's dogged pursuit of optimizing the density of useful stuff within it, in spite of its size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla's secret manufacturing plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the premise behind the \" machine that builds the machine \"—an idea that Musk talks about often, including in the video, and that he is clearly fascinated, and maybe even a little obsessed with. In this case, that obsession could help the company push battery prices even lower and squeeze even more production capacity out of the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla has pushed the idea of the machine that builds the machine to a point where it hopes to produce 150 gigawatt hours of batteries in the same volumetric space as the original design, according to Musk.\n",

      "How Democrats Embraced Gun Control at Their Convention\n",
      "Christine Leinonen, a former state trooper from Polk City, Fla., stood stricken onstage, struggling to read the words about her son on the TelePrompTer at the rear of the convention hall. Christopher “Drew” Leinonen died six weeks ago, along with his boyfriend Juan and 47 others, in the massacre at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Christopher was my only child, and as I used to tell him, you can’t do better than perfect,” his mother told the delegates at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday night. “Where was common sense the day he died? I never want you to ask that question about your child. That’s why I support Hillary Clinton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Leinonen struggled to speak those words, but they were carefully chosen. Common sense is one of the terms that gun-control lobbyists advise their clients and allies to use when framing their arguments about the fraught subject of guns, lest opponents weaponize their words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pollster Anna Greenberg, who works with the gun-control group Americans for Responsible Solutions, tells supporters to talk about “the gun lobby,” but not the National Rifle Association, which in many voters’ minds is about hunting and sport. Talk about closing loopholes, not about stricter gun laws. Talk about background checks, not a national gun registry. And never promise that anything is a fix-all or use the loaded phrase “gun control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By using the right arguments and language to bring more Americans into our movement, galvanize our allies and fight back against the gun lobby, we can win this fight,” according to a strategy memo circulated to allies in Philadelphia this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "This style of messaging played out in events around Philadelphia this week as Hillary Clinton prepared to accept her party’s nomination. Unlike other recent Democratic presidential campaigns, Clinton has made combating gun violence a signature issue. And in Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, she picked a running made who is a longtime foe of the National Rifle Association, which called itself a civil rights group when the Republicans met in Cleveland for their convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tim Kaine is someone who has put gun violence prevention front and center,” gun-control activist Mark Kelly told reporters at a lunch this week. “It’s clearly not 1994 any more.” That was the year Democrats passed an assault weapons ban, only to pay the political price in disastrous midterm elections that helped Republicans retake Congress. Since then, candidates have tried not to provoke the powerful gun rights groups, even as there are more than 33,000 gun deaths every year and more than 130,000 shootings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in Clinton, gun-control activists think they have a champion for their cause. “In the White House, Hillary will stand up to the gun lobby,” said former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived a mass shooting in 2001 in her hometown of Tucson and is married to Kelly. “That’s why I’m voting for Hillary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton’s team is betting the public’s thinking has shifted. High-profile shootings like Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Orlando nightclub have added to public anxiety, and allies see a political upside to taking on gun-rights activists. “People’s minds were certainly changed around Sandy Hook, but the cumulative effect of these tragedies is starting to increase the intensity of the attention we give this issue,” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the party’s leading voices against gun violence. Some 90% of Americans now support a strengthened background-check system. “If Hillary Clinton wins, she wins with a mandate on this issue,” Murphy told reporters on Tuesday. “And that’s the first time in 20 years that you have a presidential candidate run openly and strongly on the issue of guns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the political climate for gun-control activists is better than at any time in recent memory. “Finally this issue has become the defining issue that it’s always deserved to be,” Gross told TIME. “The gun lobby is much more of a paper tiger than people have long assumed. This is an issue where voters are prepared to hold our elected leaders accountable.” Look for anti-gun groups to use the same approach to House and Senate races, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first two nights of the Democratic convention, speakers were largely silent about the topic. That changed Wednesday evening. A procession of speakers—activists, celebrities and Americans who have lost family members to gun violence—took the podium in Philadelphia to issue wrenching pleas for tighter gun laws. Many of them deployed the language that pollsters like Greenberg advise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We need to take action, and we need to take action now,” producer and director Lee Daniels told the crowd. “There’s only one candidate willing on the gun lobby and keep our families safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rev. Jesse Jackson called Clinton a fighter who would “make us more secure by banning assault weapons that are turning our communities into killing fields.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Erica Smegielski, a young woman from Connecticut whose mother was the principal at Sandy Hook and died in the massacre, told the hall that “what we need is another mother who’s willing to do what’s right. Whose bravery can live up in equal measure to my mom’s. What we need is to elect Hillary Clinton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The point was driven home again and again. And the message was clear: Gun regulation would be debate front and center in the 2016 election.\n",

A Faraday cage works by installing copper wire mesh and tin foil (yes, those conspiracy theorists latched onto real science) around a space, diverting the invisible electomagnetic fields that swirl around electronics of all kinds. It’s a neat, legal way (Gin Tub owner Steve Tyler made sure to check) way to keep patrons focused on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "More and more places are fixated on controlling cell phone use, particularly within the live music world. For folks like Tyler, who make their living ostensibly off of bringing people together, cell phones are a huge distraction from the real reason people should be in a space. Of course, most of us are guilty of turning to our phones to get away from people, but that should, in theory, be determined and controlled by ourselves. However, patrons of the Gin Tub are enjoying the change, and of course, Tyler is too: “I think I’ve hit a nerve in the world, that I think it’s rude, and I think society has accepted people on their phones in bars and in places where it’s socially unacceptable.”\n",

      "Scientists told Self that it has to do with a preference for darkness. The darkness is simply easier for bed bugs to hide in, where as yellow or white is much brighter and therefore less of an appealing hiding place.

      "If you only read one thing: Hillary Clinton’s campaign accepted the Commission on Presidential Debates’ invitation to participate in three scheduled bouts this fall, the first on September 26 at Hofstra University on Long Island. In a public statement, the campaign then toyed with Donald Trump’s criticism of the debate schedule, suggesting he was trying to avoid the contests, before calling on him to commit to attending. Clinton’s early confidence aside, the debates stand as one of the greatest wildcards outstanding in this campaign, with the unpredictable Trump facing the very predictable Clinton, fireworks are assured. According to Clinton aides, they are essentially burdened with preparing for multiple debates with whichever Donald Trump shows up, whether the bombastic bomb-thrower, the subdued school-boy, or someone in between. Trump, meanwhile, has done little thinking about the debates, save for complaining about their conflict with football games. While he debated a dozen times in the primaries, he has never debated one-on-one with a candidate. Through all of the last year he played his rivals off each other, but this will be a very different format that won’t allow him to fade into the background as he has in debates past. Tens of millions of voters will tune in, and what transpires will almost certainly shift votes.\n",

      "Donald Trump displayed the sort of discipline Republican leaders have been looking to see for months Monday as he withstood more than a dozen protestors at his economic speech in Detroit and stayed on message. His campaign was so proud it sent out a fundraising email trumpeting just that. But it was only one day. Trump is back to holding rallies today, and that will be the real test of whether he is ready to put that last two weeks behind him. On Twitter Monday evening, it appeared Trump wanted to keep some of the controversy alive, as he suggested without evidence—claiming “many people are saying”—that the execution of an Iranian scientist who provided information to U.S. intelligence was related to Hillary Clinton’s emails.\n",

      "Gallup Found People Less Likely to Vote For Donald Trump\n",

      "\n",
      "Two Gallup surveys of 1,000 adults after each convention found that just 36 percent said they were more likely to vote for Trump after watching the GOP proceedings, while 51 percent said they were less likely, a 15 percentage point disadvantage.\n",

      "5 Reasons Why Fewer People Are Shopping at Target\n",
      "If you’ve been shopping less at Target lately, you’re not alone. Foot traffic in stores is down 2.2%. Comparable store sales fell 1.1% during the May-July period, the first time in two years there’s been a decline during these months.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Target is now saying that it anticipates further strife in the months ahead: The company is projecting that sales will dip as much as 2% during the third and fourth quarters of 2016—which include the key back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons—after previously forecasting growth between 1.5% and 2.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all according to the earnings report released by Target on Wednesday for the second quarter of 2016, ending July 30. Understandably, shares of Target stock have been taking a beating as a result, down around 5% early on Wednesday. Why are shoppers turning away from Target? Here are some reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "Groceries. As we reported earlier this week, Target has struggled mightily with its decade-long push to become a go-to grocery destination for shoppers. Target sits “in the middle of no man’s land” among grocery competitors, Target COO John Mulligan has admitted, because it lacks the quality and selection of Whole Foods and has higher prices than Walmart and Aldi.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons stores like Target have grocery sections in the first place is to boost foot traffic, as shoppers tend to need groceries more regularly than clothing or electronics. The idea is that shoppers are more likely to make other, non-planned purchases during grocery runs. But if consumers do their regular grocery shopping elsewhere—and by most accounts, that’s what they do—then Target misses out on all the peripheral and impulse buys shoppers theoretically would have made had they been in the store to pick up milk, eggs, and such.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Next: 21 Incredibly Disturbing Facts About High Prescription Drug Prices\n",
      "\n",
      "Target’s failure to attract a broad swath of grocery shoppers, you see, has a negative trickle-down effect on sales in aisles throughout the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prescription Medications. As the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune reported, one of the reasons cited by Target CEO Brian Cornell for the company’s 2.2% decline in foot traffic was the transition of its pharmacy operations to CVS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer advocates worried that Target’s decision to let CVS run its pharmacy operations and in-store clinics would hurt competition in the marketplace and perhaps result in higher drug prices for consumers. While it’s unclear if there’s been any across-the-board impact on prescription pricing during months of transitioning to CVS, Target said the change has led to some disruptions in sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with groceries, many consumers need prescriptions on a regular basis. So if these shoppers are not going to Target to pick up their meds, Target is also missing out on all the potential trickle-down sales as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple. During Wednesday’s conference call, Cornell called out poor sales of electronics—and Apple in particular—as another reason for the company’s underwhelming performance. Apple sales were down 20% in the quarter at Target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the reason for declining Apple sales at Target is that Apple sales in general haven’t been as strong as they have in previous years. But clearly, another reason is that shoppers have found other outlets other than Target for picking up their Apple devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fashion. It’s been a long time since people referred to Target as “Tarjhay.” During the first decade of the millennium, Target enjoyed a reputation as a hot cheap chic destination thanks to frequent partnerships with fashion lines like Isaac Mizrahi and Missoni. With each launch of such goods, Target could expect sales crazes with huge lines and the kind of in-store excitement that Walmart could never dream of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read Next: 10 Things Millennials Buy Far More Often Than Everyone Else\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all the partnerships worked out well, though. The Target-Neiman Marcus collection was a disaster. More recently, Target introduced a collaboration with the Finnish designer Marimekko in the spring of 2016. The response from shoppers was fairly tepid, but not anywhere near the over-the-top successes of past fashion partnerships, including one with Lilly Pulitzer a year ago.\n",
      "\n",

      "One of the reasons people aren’t shopping at these stores is that they’re turning to cheaper “fast fashion” retailers like H&M and Primark. Another is that they’re more likely nowadays to shop online for clothes—specifically at Amazon.

What’s more, analysts say that Target’s e-commerce operations, which got off the ground more slowly than most of the field, are still far behind the competition.

      "Monday morning (Aug. 1), Baltimore police officers entered Korryn Shandawn Gaines’ apartment building with the intent of carrying out arrest warrants on Gaines and an unidentified male. What ensued was a shoot out that left a woman dead, a child injured and a police department treading carefully through an onslaught of questions and speculation.\n",

      "Reportedly, a bench warrant for Gaines’ arrest had been issued following her failure to appear in court to face charges related to cases of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest following a traffic stop back in March. The unidentified male was wanted on assault charges. After identifying themselves and knocking on the door of her apartment for a period of time, officers acquired the key to Gaines’ apartment from her landlord and opened the door to find themselves face to face with the barrel of the long gun Gaines reportedly wielded at them while seated on the floor holding her 5-year-old son.\n",

Armacost says that Gaines continuously threatened officers verbally with her weapon pointed at them. Following the threats, an officer fired at Gaines, she fired several shots back, which were returned with more shots from officers, this time striking the 23-year-old multiple times and killing her. Her 5-year-old son which she was holding was injured during the encounter, but is said to have non-life threatening wounds and is expected to survive.\n",

      "Donald Trump Economy: What He Got Wrong on Unemployment\n",
      "Correction appended, Aug. 9, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "In his speech on the economy Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump touched on one of his favorite topics: the supposedly huge number of Americans who don’t have a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamenting “a silent nation of jobless Americans,” Trump rattled off a string of well-worn statistics that he’s also cited in stump speeches and interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed. One in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers,” he said. “The five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s numbers are meant to paint the American economy in a bad light. But they don’t back up the story he’s telling. Rather, they paint a portrait of how American demographics are changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read More: Transcript of Donald Trump’s Economic Speech in Detroit\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the labor force participation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump is correct that fewer Americans, as a percentage of the total population, are engaged in traditional employment today. But that’s not proof that Americans are unemployed, by any traditional measure, or even underemployed. It’s evidence that the Baby Boomer generation—a massive hunk of American labor force—is currently retiring, while the next-largest generation, the Millennials, has yet to start working en masse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Millennials, born between about 1980 and 1995, are still in college or graduate school, taking care of young children or otherwise not fully engaged in the labor force yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s claim that one-in-five American households “do not have a single member in the labor force” is also therefore not a reflection of employment problems so much as it’s a recognition that 20% of American households are headed by retirees. Your 85-year-old grandfather and his 82-year-old wife aren’t participating in the labor force—and that’s probably a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s claim that the unemployment rate, which was 4.9% in July, is a “hoax” is problematic for the same reasons: He’s measuring the wrong thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview last summer with TIME, Trump claimed the “real” unemployment rate was about four times what the Bureau of Labor Statistics says it is. “We have a real unemployment rate that’s probably 21%. It’s not 6. It’s not 5.2 and 5.5,” he said. “Our real unemployment rate—in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment—because you have ninety million people that aren’t working. Ninety-three million to be exact. If you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s line of argument, which dates back at least to the 1960s, is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t accurately include people who have given up looking for work. But, again, the demographics of the American population tell a different story.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s true that roughly 42%, or 93 million, Americans don’t have jobs, most of that population is made up of teenagers, retirees, or stay-at-home caregivers. According to federal statistics, there are roughly 46 million Americans aged 60 and up and 10 million American teenagers. While the number of full-time caregivers is less firm, a 2015 AARP study found that roughly 34 million Americans provided care in the past 12 months to an elderly person. Nearly 25% of Americans, mostly women, are full-time stay-at-home parents, according to U.S. Census data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventy-one percent of 16- and 17-year-olds don’t have a job; 92% of people over 75-years-old are “unemployed” too by that same measure. (The federal government includes children as young as 16 in the labor force statistics; small children and junior high school students aren’t included in anyone’s calculations.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, including grandma, your 16-year-old cousin, and a stay-at-home mom among the ranks of the “unemployed” might be technically accurate—they aren’t participating in the traditional workforce—but it doesn’t tell us anything interesting about the state of the U.S. economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump claim Monday that 58% of African-American youth are “either outside the labor force or not employed” makes a similar statistical mistake: it includes all African-Americans, beginning at 16 years old, who are in high school, college, graduate school, or otherwise voluntarily out of the workforce. The real unemployment rate for African Americans 16 to 19 years old is closer to 31.8%, which is much higher than it should be, but hardly pushing 60%.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these sorts of statistics, Trump misses an opportunity to address the more immediate concerns that many his supporters—particularly white, working class Americans—are experiencing today. Many in his base are legitimately frustrated with the current economy: wages are growing painfully slowly; service jobs are less lucrative than the union-backed factory and mining jobs of a generation ago; and health care, child care, and education are vastly more costly today, as a percentage of income, than they were three decades ago. Those are all issues that many working class Americans feel in their bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the numbers Trump used Monday don’t tell that story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correction: The original version of this story misstated the unemployment rate in July 2016. It was 4.9%.\n",

      "The Kansas boy was decapitated Sunday while going down the 168-foot-tall Verruckt water slide at the Schlitterbahn Water Park, police told TIME on Tuesday.

      "\n",
      "The GoFundMe account — created by Michael Persaud, a volunteer at the church who taught Caleb and other children in Bible classes — surpassed its $15,000 goal in just one day.

      "The boy’s father, Republican state Rep. Scott Schwab, mourned the “sudden loss” of his son in a statement through the fundraising page. “Since the day he was born he brought abundant joy to our family and all those who he came in contact with,” the statement said. “As we try and mend our home with him no longer with us, we are in comfort knowing he believed in his Savior, Jesus, and they are forever together now. We will see him another day.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Visitation will be held 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at LifeMission Church in Olathe, Kansas, according to the GoFundMe page. A memorial service is planned for Friday at 2 p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been devastating at every level. You know leave church, you go to a water park to be with family and to enjoy. And then you hit tragedy,” Sprague said. “There is just no way to prepare for this.”\n",

      "Hillary Clinton: Why Vladimir Putin Has a Grudge Against Her\n",
      "In December 2011, Vladimir Putin came closer than he’s ever been to losing his hold on power. His decision that year to run for a third term as Russia’s President had inspired a massive protest movement against him. Demonstrations calling for him to resign were attracting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some of his closest allies had defected to the opposition, causing a split in the Kremlin elites, and Russian state media had begun to warn of a revolution in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a crisis meeting with his advisers on Dec. 8 of that year, the Russian leader chose to lay the blame on one meddling foreign diplomat: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She set the tone for certain actors inside the country; she gave the signal,” Putin said of Clinton at the time, accusing her of ordering the opposition movement into action like some kind of revolutionary sleeper cell. “They heard this signal and, with the support of the U.S. State Department, started actively doing their work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Five years later, the U.S. presidential elections may have given Putin his chance for getting even. According to Clinton’s campaign staff and a number of cyber-security experts, Russian hackers in the service of the Kremlin were behind last week’s leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee. The hacked messages appeared to show DNC officials, who are meant to remain neutral during the Democratic Party’s primary race, favoring Clinton over her then-rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reactions to the leak so far, including from Clinton’s campaign managers, have focused on what Russia would have to gain from helping Donald Trump win the Presidency. Trump’s flattering remarks about Putin in the past, as well as his recent equivocating about whether the U.S. should defend NATO allies in case of a Russian attack, would seem to support the notion that Trump is Russia’s favored candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Kremlin has indeed begun interfering in the presidential race on Trump’s behalf, the bad blood between Putin and Clinton would seem like enough of a motivation. Putin’s list of grievances goes back a lot further than Clinton’s alleged support for the Russian protest movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2009, soon after President Obama took office, his newly appointed Secretary of State initiated what the White House called a “reset” in relations with Russia. At the time, Putin had already positioned himself as an adversary to the U.S., or at least a check on American influence in the world, and he showed no inclination for making friends with Obama. But constitutional term limits had forced Putin to switch to the less powerful role of Prime Minister the previous year, and his younger protégé, Dmitri Medvedev, then took over the presidency. In sharp contrast to his mentor, Medvedev began to cast himself as a liberal Westernizer with a particular affection for high-tech American gadgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "That presented Washington an opportunity and, in the first year of Obama’s presidency, the U.S. tried to sidestep Putin and build better relations with Russia through Medvedev. As Secretary of State, Clinton oversaw these efforts, which saw the two Presidents visit each other’s countries—Obama in 2009, Medvedev in 2010—and establish a range of bilateral commissions to cooperate on everything from counter-terrorism to the tech economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But among Kremlin hardliners, who have since come to dominate Russian politics, Clinton’s efforts to flatter and befriend Medvedev all seemed like part of a scheme to undermine Putin and subvert his role as a counterweight to U.S. dominance in world affairs. One incident in particular drove home that perception.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring of 2011, the U.S. and its allies began pushing for a military intervention in Libya to prevent the regime of Muammar Ghaddafi from massacring rebel forces and their civilian supporters. But without Russia’s acquiescence, the West could not pass a resolution in the U.N. that would provide a legal basis for the intervention. So Clinton and Obama began pressuring Medvedev to play along, and he ultimately agreed not to veto the resolution in the U.N. Security Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putin was furious. The resolution, he said, resembled “the medieval calls for a Christian crusade,” one that Clinton, as the top U.S. diplomat at the time, helped to orchestrate. Later that same year, when Russia’s flawed parliamentary elections set off a season of street protests, Clinton spoke up in support of the demonstrations. “The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,” Clinton said. “And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fairly tame statement of support for the Russian opposition movement. But Putin took it as a personal affront against his leadership, as well as a sign that Clinton was intent on manipulating the Russian presidential elections that were then just a few months away.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a campaign based on Cold War rhetoric against the conniving West, Putin won that vote handily, and it is easy to see how he would relish the chance to manipulate the U.S. presidential elections in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least in his public statements, he has tried not to take sides between Clinton and Trump too overtly. Asked during a panel discussion in June about his statements that Trump is a “colorful” politician, Putin said that Russia “never interferes in the internal political processes of other countries, especially the United States.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of whom the U.S. electorate chooses as its leader in November, Putin said, Russia would work with the new American President in the hope of restoring constructive ties. “The world needs a strong country like the U.S., and we need it, too,” he said. “What we don’t need is for them to constantly interfere in our business and tell us how to live.” Considering his experience with Clinton’s supposed meddling in Russian affairs, it seems clear which candidate he would trust not to interfere in the Kremlin’s business.\n",

      "Jon Stewart’s digital animated series is still on track for a launch before the November Presidential election. “My hope is that it will be up and running by September or October,” HBO’s programming chief Casey Bloys said Saturday at TCA.\n",
      "\n",
      "He revealed more details about the show. “It’s an animated parody of a cable news network. It’s Onion-like, with video and text,” he said. “It’s very much Jon’s voice and tone.” (Stewart also voices the show.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The animation is done in a way that “allows (Stewart) to comment on events in real time,” Bloys said. (CBS’ Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which Stewart executive produces, has been using a similar technique, most recently with an animated Hillary Clinton this week.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to running on HBO’s digital platforms, the Jon Stewart show is also expected to air on the linear channel, probably in a half-hour format, Bloys said.\n",

      "In announcing the four-year deal with Stewart last November, HBO said that Stewart would work with the cloud graphics company OTOY Inc. “to develop new technology that will allow him to produce timely, current-events-focused short-form digital content, which will be refreshed on HBO NOW multiple times throughout the day.”\n",

One subsection of the agenda, “End the War on Black People,” takes on the criminal justice system.

      "For some, the agenda may help dispel the myth that the movement itself is set on violence. For others, it will confirm their worst fears.

Sure, things may have lightened up a bit since he’s in the final months of his presidential tenure, but he’s probably still got some stuff to do, papers to shuffle. You know, President stuff. However, the man still has time to listen to music, and he proved this by dropping another edition of his signature summer playlist. And after a look at his selections, one thing is for sure: The man has an interesting taste in music.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are technically two playlists, one for day and one for night, and both seem like they actually had some thought put into them. He could have easily had some staffer slap together a list of hit summer jams, but that’s not what this is. The daytime playlist in particular is fascinating with President Obama choosing Courtney Barnett! It’s enough to make you forgive him for including the somewhat basic “Home” by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. Daytime also includes artists such as Wale, Janelle Monae, Prince, Common, and Gary Clark Jr.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nighttime list has many a fine selection as well. You’ve got D’Angelo and Chance the Rapper and Miles Davis. That being said, one song jumps out. President Obama is into “Criminal” by Fiona Apple. One, that just feels like baiting Donald Trump. Two, can you imagine a sitting President of the United States watching the music video for that song? For what it’s worth, if things go south following this upcoming election, Obama might have to agree with Fiona about what this world would be.\n",

After Efimova competed in the 100-m breaststroke semifinals, she waved a “No. 1” finger in the air––mimicking American Lilly King, who did it after an earlier swim in the event. King was not pleased. “You wave your finger No. 1, and you’ve been caught drug cheating?” King said on NBC after her semifinal. “I’m not a fan.” King then won gold over Efimova the next night, and barely concealed her disgust afterwards. “It just proves that you can compete clean and still come out on top with all the work you put in,” King said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her stand followed that of Australian swimmer Mack Horton, who beat China’s Sun Yang to win gold in the 400-m freestyle on Aug. 6 and called Sun, who served a three-month ban for testing positive for a banned stimulant in 2014, a “drug cheat.” After the race, Horton said his win was one “for the good guys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Their strong words were supported by other swimmers, including Michael Phelps, and applauded by many fans and commentators. But it’s about to become far more difficult for the U.S. to cling to its perch atop the moral high ground. American swimmers and gymnasts have rarely been caught up in cheating scandals, and the current teams in these sports, according the drug testers, are squeaky clean. The same, however, can’t be said for the U.S. in track and field, which is soon to take center stage in Rio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent past isn’t filled with “good guys,” as it were: the early 2000s ensnared many of America’s biggest names in the sport, including Marion Jones, a star at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, who admitted to using steroids and was stripped of her medals. Tim Montgomery’s 100-m world record, set in 2002, was stripped. And the current team in Rio includes athletes who’ve been suspended for doping. Justin Gatlin, America’s fastest man at the 2016 Olympics, tested positive for performance-enhancing drug use in 2006, and served a four-year ban. Tyson Gay, a member of the U.S. 4 X 100 relay roster in Rio, tested positive for an anabolic steroid in 2013, costing the entire U.S. 4 X 100 relay team at the London Olympics their silver medals.\n",

      "Read More: Justin Gatlin Has A Final Chance at Redemption\n",
      "\n",
      "King herself said Gatlin and Gay shouldn’t be in Rio. “Do I think people who have been caught doping should be on the team?” King said. “They shouldn’t. It is unfortunate we have to see that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia is far virtuous here, either. Track’s global governing body banned all but one Russian track athlete from Rio after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency found rampant performance-enhancing drug use on the team. And on Saturday that lone holdout, long jumper Darya Klishina, was also suspended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Gatlin – who denies that he’s ever knowingly taken a banned substance, and insists he’s currently clean – realizes he can’t criticize the Russians like the swimmers have. “I guess I don’t have much of a soap box to stand on when it comes to situations like this,” he said during a June interview with TIME, after being asked about the blanket ban on Russia’s Olympic track team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Americans may stack up medals on the track in Rio, but they’ll have to table their righteousness on that podium.\n",

      "Donald Trump Ends Standoff With Paul Ryan as He Works to Repair Damage\n",
      "(GREEN BAY, Wis.)—In an effort to repair some of the damage he had inflicted on his presidential campaign, Donald Trump endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan to end a four-day standoff that exposed the deeps chasms in the Republican Party over his candidacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump struck a rare conciliatory tone at a Wisconsin rally on Friday, imploring his party to unite behind him and opening a full-throttle attack on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arm in arm, we will rescue the country from the Obama-Clinton disaster,” Trump told supporters after formally declaring his support for Ryan in next week’s congressional primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will have disagreements,” Trump said just days after refusing to endorse the Wisconsin Republican. “But we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an unusual gesture for Trump, who is known for his refusal to admit mistakes and his tendency to double down when he’s under attack. Trump’s general election campaign has been defined by his constant attacks on fellow Republicans — a habit that has baffled party leaders, who have begged him to stay focused on his Democratic rival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The refusal to back Ryan had been seen by many as a final straw. Trump had told The Washington Post in an interview earlier this week that he was “just not quite there yet” when it came to backing Ryan — language that echoed the words used by Ryan as he weighed whether to endorse the party’s nominee.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to praising Ryan, Trump also threw his support behind Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying he held the senator “in the highest esteem … for his service to our country in uniform and in public office.” In the past, Trump questioned McCain’s status as a war hero, and told the Post he felt McCain “should have done a much better job for the vets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also endorsed New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, with whom he has also sparred, calling her “a rising star.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan, like other top Wisconsin Republicans, did not attend Trump’s evening appearance in their state. He reiterated his support for Trump hours before the endorsement, but he noted that his support wasn’t a “blank check” and pledged to speak out against the businessman’s divisive positions if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also skipped the evening rally, preferring to attend an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos offered a blunt message ahead of the presidential nominee’s arrival: “We are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Midwest mayhem underscored Trump’s mounting challenges during one of the most tumultuous weeks of his unorthodox campaign. He has skipped from one misstep to the next, sparking a fresh wave of Republican defections among longtime party loyalists who refuse to support their presidential nominee —some even publicly support Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eager to change their minds, Trump unleashed a torrent of insults at Clinton throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Hillary Clinton becomes president,” he said at a rally in Iowa, “you will have really, in my opinion, the destruction of this country from within.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump called his Democratic opponent “a dangerous liar,” ”an unbalanced person,” ”pretty close to unhinged,” ”totally unfit to lead” and lacking “the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In one way, she’s a monster,” he said in Wisconsin. “In another way, she’s a weak person. She’s actually not strong enough to be president.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The charges came soon after Clinton addressed her own political vulnerabilities while facing a group of minority journalists in Washington. The former secretary of state sought to “clarify and explain” a recent statement on “Fox News Sunday” that FBI Director James Comey said her answers to the bureau about her use of a private email server were “truthful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may have short-circuited and for that I will try to clarify,” Clinton said, though still insisting she “never sent or received anything that was marked classified.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She also acknowledged that many people don’t trust her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn’t make me feel good when people say those things, and I recognize that I have work to do,” Clinton said. She added, “I’m going to work my heart out in this campaign and as president to produce results for people.”\n",

      "Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2014, Renée Zellweger stepped onto the red carpet for the first time since 2010, and she was immediately excoriated by the media for they said was facial plastic surgery (Zellweger has repeatedly denied that she has participated in any procedures). It was upsetting to see Zellweger put under this judgmental microscope, and the media circus reminded us just how unforgiving our culture is about women aging.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Zellweger’s new movie Bridget Jones’ Baby coming out in September and Renee back in the limelight, the actress took to the Huffington Post to pen a personal essay detailing how she feels about this toxic culture of humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no secret a woman’s worth has historically been measured by her appearance,” Zellweger writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although we have evolved to acknowledge the importance of female participation in determining the success of society, and take for granted that women are standard bearers in all realms of high profile position and influence, the double standard used to diminish our contributions remains, and is perpetuated by the negative conversation which enters our consciousness every day as snark entertainment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zellweger holds the culture at large accountable, but she specifically focuses on the media in her essay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What if immaterial tabloid stories, judgments, and misconceptions remained confined to the candy jar of low-brow entertainment and were replaced in mainstream media by far more important, necessary conversations?” Zellweger asks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What if we were more careful and more conscientious about the choices we make for ourselves, where we choose to channel our energy and what we buy into; remembering that information — both factual and fictitious — is frequently commodified as a product, and the contents and how we use it are of significant personal, social and public consequence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then puts forth a possible answer to these questions, and it’s pretty simple. In a powerful conclusion, Zellweger suggests that we need to search our own feelings about why we line up to be spectators for humiliation, and what exactly it is that makes us focus on surface-level concerns instead of the many pressing real problems society is facing.\n",

      "The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 just got even better. The most muscular version of Chevy’s sixth-generation Camaro will have 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque, according to a leaked order guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 107-page guide was posted on enthusiast site Camaro6.com, ahead of an official General Motors announcement of the final specs. When GM unveiled the ZL1 at the 2016 New York Auto Show back in March, it quoted figures of 640 hp and 640 lb-ft of torque. It’s always nice when 10 hp and 10 lb-ft materialize seemingly out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means the ZL1 now matches the output for the Corvette Z06, with which it shares a 6.2-liter supercharged LT4 V8 engine.GM apparently isn’t worried about the Camaro stealing the Corvette’s thunder, or overshadowing the Cadillac CTS-V luxury sedan. That car also uses the LT4 engine, but is rated at 640 hp and 630 lb-ft. The ZL1 also debuts a new 10-speed automatic co-developed with Ford, while the Corvette and Caddy use eight-speed autos. The Corvette is also available with a seven-speed manual, while the ZL1 uses a six-speed.\n",

      "Even with a 10-horsepower bump, though, the ZL1 can’t match the 707-hp output of the almighty Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. The 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi Hellcat may still be the most powerful muscle car engine, but the ZL1 will likely be the more well rounded of the two. The lighter Camaro body and more sophisticated suspension should the ZL1 a better track car, even if it won’t win every drag race.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ZL1 uses GM’s Magnetic Ride suspension, which includes magnetorheological dampers filled with fluid impregnated with iron filings that can adjusted near-instantaneously by running a current through it. GM also claims the ZL1 will be fully track ready from the factory, thanks to features like 11 standard heat exchangers. We’ll see how it stacks up against the current track-going muscle car champ, Ford’s Shelby GT350R Mustang.\n",

      "If you only read one thing: Democrats are riding high on a sea of public and private polls showing Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead over Donald Trump in enough swing states to clear 270 Electoral Votes if the election were held today. Her campaign and her super PAC, Priorities USA, are cutting advertising buys in states they are growing more confident in and shifting them toward expanding the map—which will keep Trump on defense through Election Day. Yet all of that confidence comes with a risk, as President Barack Obama warned donors on Martha’s Vineyard Monday night, that in growing complacent they will fail to turn out the voters they need to win. With 84 days left, there is plenty of time for the polls to rise and fall, particularly around the fall debates.\n",

      "Donald Trump’s foreign policy speech Monday was an attempt to turn the page on a brutal three weeks for his campaign, but his remarks were riddled with factual inaccuracies—most notably about his own record. Trump criticized the Iraq War he initially supported, then criticized Obama’s rapid troop withdrawal—which he also supported. The same goes for the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, both of which he criticized Monday but supported at the time. While criticizing nation building, he called once again for seizing Iraqi oil, in effect creating a permanent occupation of the country. And he revised his blanket ban on Muslim immigration to a ban on immigration from un-listed high-risk areas, while adding an ideological screening test to ensure those who visit respect American values. And as Trump advisors looked to have him project a presidential image, Trump once again got in his own way, ad-libbing to call his new immigration proposals “extreme vetting” and promising to be “extreme” in responding to radical Islamic extremism.\n",

But while the competition was fierce in the water, the bigger fight between the two is actually happening on dry land — and it's starting to get very dirty.\n",

      "In 2014, Yang tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine during the Chinese nationals and was suspended from swimming for three months. Yang insisted he was prescribed the drug to help with heart palpitations, but Horton clearly never bought it, and has made his feelings about doping very clear in multiple press interviews leading up to and during the Olympics. To make matters worse, during a training session prior to the Olympics, Yang allegedly splashed some water into Horton's lane, which the swimmer took as a personal attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He just kind of splashed me, but I ignored him because I don't have time or respect for drug cheats,\" Horton said following the preliminary heats this weekend, according to the Washington Post. \"He wasn't too happy about that, so he kept splashing me.

      "\n",
      "\"I just have a problem with athletes who have tested positive and are still competing,\" Horton said at the press conference following the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Yang — who was awkwardly sitting right next to him — responded by saying, \"On the competition stage, every athlete deserves to be respected, and there's no need to use these sort of cheap tricks to affect each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the same conference, when confronted by the Chinese media as to why he attacked Yang by calling him a drug cheat, Horton doubled down on his original sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used the words drug cheat because he tested positive,\" he said, calling his win \"a win for the good guys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know if it's a rivalry between me and him, just me and athletes who have tested positive,\" he continued, according to the Washington Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, fans of Yang were not too pleased by the spat, and Horton's social media soon became flooded with snake emojis and commenters demanding he apologize to Yang for his remarks. Superfans of Yang were especially vicious due to the fact Yang was seen crying after losing his title — and it got so bad, Horton shut down comments on his Instagram altogether. Even China's media attacked the Australian swimmer, directly calling his home country \"uncivilized\" and his victory \"disgraceful,\" according to Yahoo News.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Australian media and officials have stuck by Horton's side, and the Australian Olympic Committee released a statement this weekend stating, \"He has spoken out in support of clean athletes. This is something he feels strongly about and good luck to him.\"\n",

      "Patrick Brown, Jailed Because He Could Not Afford Bail, Beaten to Death Within 48 Hours\n",
      "A man in Harris County, Texas, was beaten to death in a jail cell on April 5 less than 48 hours after failing to post bail, authorities told the Houston Press. Patrick Joseph Brown, 46, was booked on a misdemeanor theft charge on April 3 for allegedly stealing a guitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, Brown was denied a personal bond at his hearing and asked to pay $3,000 to walk free — an amount he could not afford. He was then sent to the Harris County Jail to await trial. Less than 48 hours later, he was found unresponsive in the holding cell he'd shared with several other men, including Curtis Maxwell and Ebenezer Nah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maxwell and Nah had beaten Brown to within an inch of his life. He was pronounced dead at nearby Memorial Hermann Hospital soon after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Google Maps\n",
      "\n",
      "All three men were reportedly booked on either April 2 or 3, meaning they'd been in the jail together three days at most. Maxwell and Nah have both been charged with aggravated assault causing seriously bodily injury, Harris County Sheriff's spokesman Ryan Sullivan told the Press last Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still unclear what caused the dispute that led to Brown's murder, but according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, homicide is a rare cause of death in local jails — lagging far behind illness and suicide, the two leading causes. Nevertheless, the 46-year-old's exposure to factors that led to his demise remain a stark reminder of the consequences America's criminal justice system holds for those who can't shoulder its financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "In places like Harris County, Ferguson, Missouri, Montgomery, Alabama, and elsewhere, poor people easily get ensnared in a cycle of debt and incarceration, as their inability to pay fees stemming from minor offenses incur increasingly more financial, and legal, penalties. The result is a system where being poor becomes a de facto crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, guards are supposed to check on inmates at the Harris County Jail every 15 minutes, and it was during one of these checks that Brown's prone body was discovered. One of Brown's former girlfriends told the Houston Chronicle that he left behind a teenage son, who is devastated by the loss of his father.\n",

      "Do Aliens Exist? Here's What Scientists Say About Life on Other Planets\n",
      "Humans have always wondered about life beyond the stars. The curiosity doesn't only stem from popular culture and the advent of film and television, but even before then. Books, oral stories and painting depicted \"evidence\" of aliens. People have always thought about extraterrestrial life, what aliens would look like, and if the creatures would come in peace, if they exist. But what are the nation's scientists and researchers saying about the potential existence of aliens?\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA's administrator believes we are not alone. In 2015, Charles Bolden, who has been the administrator of NASA since 2009, said, \"I do believe that we will someday find other forms of life or a form of life, if not in our solar system then in some of the other solar systems — the billions of solar systems in the universe,\" according to the Telegraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why 7 Experts Are Convinced Alien Life Might Really Exist\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today we know that there are literally thousands, if not millions of other planets, many of which may be very similar to our own earth,\" the 69-year-old former astronaut continued. \"So some of us, many of us believe that we're going to find ... evidence that there is life elsewhere in the universe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the History Channel, Frank Drake, a notable astronomer, created an equation that was able to \"estimate the likelihood of the existence of alien life, taking into account a number of factors including the average number of planets able to support life and the fraction that could go on to support intelligent life.\" The equation found that \"hundreds of thousands\" of planets that could support extraterrestrial beings could (and should) exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why haven't they contacted us? There are several hypotheses that try to explain why aliens haven't reached out to Earthlings. One theory, titled the \"Zoo hypothesis,\" posits that aliens are actually preventing us from contacting them, so that the extraterrestrial beings don't interrupt our natural development. In short, Earth might be a \"zoo\" for aliens, to watch our growth as a species.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fermi Paradox is multi-layered, but a branch of the theory known as the Rare Earth Hypothesis essentially posits that humanity is the only species to have made it through the \"Great Filter,\" a set of circumstances that make life possible, such as living on a planet that is just close enough to the Sun, or having just the right set of evolutionary events occur to create life. The Rare Earth Hypothesis believes that these set of circumstances are so infinitesimally small, that no other life in the universe is able to replicate it. Humanity won the cosmic lottery!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no way to know for sure if aliens exist or not, that is until we are contacted. This could be dangerous and we should be cautious of alien life, Stephen Hawking, one of the world's leading minds on the cosmos, warns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare,\" the 74-year-old physicist said at the 50th anniversary celebration of NASA in 2008, according to the Daily Galaxy. \"Some would say it has yet to occur on earth. We should be careful if we ever happen upon extraterrestrial life. Watch out if you would meet an alien. You could be infected with a disease with which you have no resistance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But finding alien life would be a monumental step for science. Finding out that we aren't alone out there, and there are extraterrestrial beings attempting to contact humanity, opens a world of possibilities and a variety of questions. What do aliens know? What can aliens teach us? How would we interact with beings from space?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just imagine the moment, when we find potential signatures of life,\" Matt Mountain, director and James Webb telescope scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said at a seminar in NASA's headquarters in 2014. \"Imagine the moment when the world wakes up and the human race realizes that its long loneliness in time and space may be over — the possibility we're no longer alone in the universe.\"\n"

      "\n",
      "The recording, taken on April 28 by transgender woman Pearl Love, opens with another passenger on the train taunting Pearl about her makeup, handbag and feminine presentation. \"Suck my dick!\" the passenger screams before declaring that Pearl's presence \"ain't appropriate for my child.\" The recording ends with the assailant jumping out of her seat and striking Pearl, who then stops the recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she goes by Pearl Love on Facebook, Pearl, a Taiwanese transgender woman, told Mic she just goes by the first name. Pearl confirmed the authenticity of the video and said she was on the way to New York City's LGBT Community Center when the female passenger began to berate her. After five minutes of verbal harassment, Pearl said she began to record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl said she experiences harassment in public so frequently that at first she didn't find the assault out of the ordinary. \"It happens all the time basically,\" Pearl said. \"I just walk away mostly, or I go to other room or other subway.\" This is the first time Pearl has recorded an incident of harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it wasn't until after Pearl posted the video on Facebook and received an outpouring of support that she realized how terrible the ordeal had been.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pearl said she stopped the recording at that point, but says she has two other videos showing the woman chasing her around the subway car. Pearl said she has chosen not to make the two other recordings public for the time being because she found the response to the first so overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearl said that she has been moved by the outpouring of supportive comments from people on Facebook:\n",

      "As of Wednesday morning, the video has been shared over 1,000 times and viewed over 111,000 times.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even though it's 2016, women are still routinely humiliated and treated dismissively by health care providers, from doctors to pharmacists. On Thursday, a 19-year-old student who goes by momdadimrae on Reddit went to the gynecologist, where she was subjected to a slew of snide remarks after she told him she struggled with depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went to the gynecologist for the first time for an IUD consultation. In the span of 20 minutes, he belittled me for being on antidepressants since 14, told me that depression doesn't exist and I should stop whining, and yelled a nurse out of the room,\" momdadimrae wrote on Reddit. \"He kept berating me, asking me if it was school or home that made me sad and seek attention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her horror story about this sexist doctor quickly went viral, garnering hundreds of comments. Outraged users encouraged momdadimrae to report the doctor for misconduct, to which she enthusiastically replied \"I am definitely going to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, momdadimrae is not alone. Reddit is full of women sharing horror stories about their shoddy treatment at the hands of medical professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she asked to remain anonymous, momdadimrae said this was not her first experience being shamed by a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I started taking oral contraceptives when I was 16, and I had to see 3 different doctors before one would give me a prescription,\" she said in an email interview, \"because the general attitude amongst the doctors I had seen was, 'You are too immature to handle birth control.' ... Their reasoning was that I was only 16 so I shouldn't be worrying about sex and things like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until she saw a female doctor that momdadimrae finally got a prescription. (It's worth noting that in Canada, there is no minimum age for prescribing birth control; the decision is largely left up to the physicians themselves.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another user, mintcakefrog, replied to momdadimrae's story with her own humiliating experience getting an IUD. After she told the gynecologist she had stayed in a mental hospital, the doctor reportedly called in mintcakefrog's partner and \"proceeded to talk to him and asked if I was able to consent and explained the procedure to me like I was 5 years old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it's not just female patients with a history of mental health issues who are shamed by physicians. Other female patients have reported being slut-shamed by their gynecologists, including 21-year-old Reddit user ssaen, whose story went viral last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"[My OB-GYN] starts by telling me that healthy sex is between two virgins in the 'lifetime-commitment of marriage.' Obviously, she knows that I am not a virgin, and tells me that I can still make the decision to abstain from sex until I am married,\" ssaen wrote. Hundreds of women replied to this post with their own horror stories. \"I specifically asked for annual pelvics when he didn't bring it up ... He then insisted I wouldn't need them, since I wasn't married,\" commenter AptCasaNova described her experience with a male doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If nothing else, the response to momdadirae's story taught her that \"there definitely needs to be a change in how women are treated by health care professionals,\" she said in the email interview. \"I have had many doctors tell me that I should steer clear of an IUD because I might want a baby in a few months. I'm 19 years old! I have the right to make informed decisions about my body and my reproductive organs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the experiences of women on Reddit make clear, it's not momdadimrae's age that makes doctors feel they have the right to question her reproductive health choices. It's also her gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When a woman says a man has done something unacceptable to her, the first question needs to be, 'How can I help you deal with this?', rather than 'Are you sure that's really what happened?'\" she said. \"Women need to be taken seriously.\"\n",

      "Fox News host Megyn Kelly talked to North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Thursday about the anti-trans bathroom bill HB2.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was the fear that led to the enactment of this law?\" Kelly asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly asked McCrory why he was \"concerned about girls exposing themselves or seeing somebody exposed\" in women's restrooms, especially since most are equipped with individual stalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "When McCrory had to defend HB2, which requires people in North Carolina to use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth rather than their gender identity, he veered off topic and said this was a problem caused by the left and not the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly next debunked claims that HB2 promotes children's safety. After she called misconceptions about transgender people as predators \"not true,\" she again asked McCrory, \"What is your fear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Typically male molesters are heterosexual, and if they want to sneak into a bathroom they'll do it,\" Kelly said. \"But 90% of the cases, molestation happens with someone you know. So what is the fear with the transgender situation in the bathrooms?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness to Light, a sexual abuse advocacy group, corroborates Kelly's statistic — 90% of child sexual abuse happens with someone the family knows or trusts.\n",
      "\n",
      "McCrory finally answered Kelly's \"fear\" question and said families have a \"basic expectation of privacy\" when it comes to their children using a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if privacy or security is McCrory's concern, HB2 doesn't seem to be the way to achieve it. There are zero recorded instances of a transgender person doing anything in a bathroom except minding their own business.

      "\n",
      "The fear-mongering language is arguably having an effect on the safety of Muslim communities — in December the New York Times reported on a recent spike in hate crimes against Muslim Americans — but the anti-Muslim sentiment is having an effect on non-Muslim Americans too, something The Daily Show tackled in a segment on Monday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj, who is Muslim, sat down with Sikh American and artist Waris Ahluwalia, to talk about the discrimination he faces just because he \"looks Muslim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Almost every time I fly back to the U.S. I get a secondary screening,\" Ahluwalia said. \"People assume that Sikhs are Muslims and that's primarily an issue because Sikhs are an independent religion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Harvard University's Pluralism Project, \"today there are well over 500,000 Sikhs in the United States,\" but, since 9/11, Sikh Americans have become the \"targets of varying degrees of hate crimes\" because of their turbans and beards.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to hearing from Ahluwalia, Minhaj also sat down with a panel of Sikhs living in America to hear about their experiences with discrimination. \"I've been called ISIS a lot recently,\" one of the guests told Minhaj. \"The turban is what makes us the target,\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Minhaj suggests that Sikhs could avoid some of that pesky Islamophobic discrimination simply by telling everyone they're not Muslim, the answer from the group is definitive. \"It's just not an option for us to throw another community under the bus,\" one of Minhaj's guests said. \"Even if it means things are harder for us, we believe it's the right thing to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not the way I was raised,\" Ahluwalia tells Minhaj. \"That's why I wear this turban. As a reminder to myself to treat humanity with care and kindness. So that's — so I'm not here to point fingers.\"\n",
      "What Is \"Reverse Racism\"? Here's Why It Doesn't Actually Exist in the United States\n",
      "The questions have come up before: Why isn't there a White History Month? Why isn't there a network for White Entertainment Television, like BET? Black Girls Rock? What about White Girls Rock? What about the critically acclaimed Broadway play Hamilton's call for nonwhite actors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, these few examples demonstrate \"reverse racism,\" or the discrimination against members of a dominant racial group. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things like BET, Black Girls Rock or Black History Month are not reverse racist against white people,\" Zeba Blay, a Huffington Post Black Voices writer, illustrates in a video. \"Because remember, in a society where white is seen as the default race, all history is white history. But racism isn't just someone feeling superior to another race and then discriminating against them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism and prejudice aren't quite the same thing. Racism, rather, is best known as a system in which a racial majority is able to enforce its power and privilege over another race through political, economic and institutional means. Therefore racism can be described as \"prejudice plus power,\" as the two work together to create the system of inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be guilty of racism, however, to be a racist, say the revision proponents, one must have power, and power of a special sort,\" Carlos Hoyt Jr, who is an assistant professor of social work at Wheelock College, wrote in The Pedagogy of the Meaning of Racism of those who would like to change the dictionary definition of racism. \"For the revisionists, racism is prejudice plus power leveraged at an institutional level to maintain the privileges of the dominant social group.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, when the term \"reverse racism\" is brought up, it is in response to a slight that a member of the dominant group perceives has happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in reality, the United States has a long legacy of racism that makes it difficult for people of color to receive quality health care, access affordable housing, find stable employment and avoid getting wrapped up in the justice system. These examples of institutionalized racism don't quite match with the examples of reverse racism, such as \"Why don't WE have a White History Month?\"\n",

He also did wonders for the economy, which was contracting when he came to power.\n",

      "Donald Trump thinks that a wall can save America. But a stunning new study suggests that his quest to build it could end up making the very issue it's meant to resolve far worse than it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The billionaire showman has proposed a \"big, beautiful wall\" running along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border as a means to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the U.S. By his lights, the wall, which he has estimated would stand anywhere between 30 and 80 feet tall, would help put an end to \"Mexico send[ing] its people\" across the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: New Study Shows Just How Much Undocumented Immigrants Actually Contribute\n",
      "\n",
      "In all reality, if Trump becomes president he won't be able to build his wall — the logistical, fiscal and diplomatic hurtles are insurmountable. It's far more probable he would enhance the tools that already exist to clamp down on the entry of unauthorized migrants — dramatically ramping up border enforcement with more intense patrolling, and building some more fences at frequent entry-points. But his pursuit of such a crackdown could very likely backfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem: As a massive study published in March in the American Journal of Sociology reveals, consistent attempts to make it harder for migrants to enter the U.S. since the 1980s haven't done anything to decrease the undocumented immigration population. Instead, they've actually made the undocumented population far larger. And if there is another spike in undocumented immigration in the future, it could have the same counterproductive effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does cracking down on the border boost the undocumented population? It requires understanding how immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border has worked historically. Mexicans have been crossing the border into the U.S. for higher paying work in great numbers since the mid-20th century, but unlike most migrants crossing an ocean, they usually came temporarily. With a relatively inexpensive path back home and a tendency to take on seasonal work, the majority of Mexican migrants routinely cycled back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "This carried on without issue in the 1940s and 1950s, but in 1965 Congress passed the first-ever limits on immigration from the Western hemisphere. At first immigration from Mexico dipped, but by the late 1970s it had returned to the same rate that existed in the late 1950s. The immigration law changed the legal status of Mexican migrants, but it left the fundamental drivers of migration — labor supply and demand — untouched. And the old connections Mexican workers had with their U.S. employers remained intact despite the law, as well. \"Once opportunities for legal entry constricted, migration did not stop but simply continued under undocumented auspices,\" the study's authors report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact that Mexican migration trends stayed roughly the same between the 1950s and the 1970s in terms of volume and destination, a mandate for harsher crackdowns on illegal immigration grew bigger as time went on, and finally picked up serious momentum by the 1980s. Between 1986 and 2008, the U.S. saw a \"fivefold increase in the number of U.S. Border Patrol officers, a fourfold increase in hours spent patrolling the border, and a twenty fold increase in nominal funding.\" But during that same time, the undocumented population quadrupled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guarding the border more aggressively didn't deter people from coming in, but it did discourage them from leaving. Tweet\n",
      "\n",
      "The study found that the militarization of the border ultimately didn't deter workers desperate for higher wages. Migrants just developed more sophisticated techniques for crossing, increasingly relying on paid specialists, called \"coyotes,\" to make the trip. Even as border security made it tougher to cross without being caught, most migrants who failed would try again until finally making it into the U.S. But once they got into the U.S., the increased cost and difficulty of crossing made it less likely they would return to Mexico; a repeat of the whole ordeal became too expensive and risky. In other words, guarding the border more aggressively didn't deter people from coming into the U.S., but it did discourage them from leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study estimates that the late 20th and early 21st century uptick in enforcement ultimately increased the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. by a third by discouraging their return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The takeaway: The key lesson from the study is that when people are desperate to make a decent living, they'll show extraordinary resolve and ingenuity in finding a way to secure it. Given that migration from Mexico into the U.S. has actually reversed in recent years, immigration hawks needn't worry too much about a growing wave of undocumented immigrants any time soon. But should the flow of migrants pick up again, they should be wary of border crackdowns as a solution.\n",

      "The Bible. It's often cited by conservative politicians and activists in the United States, who are quick to use it as a justification to defend laws limiting the freedom of certain groups of people.\n",

      "Such is the case in North Carolina, where Republican Gov. Pat McCrory recently signed the state's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which overturned an anti-discrimination ordinance enacted by the city of Charlotte. It's most controversial element was a reversal of rules that allowed transgender Charlotte residents to use the restroom of their choice. While the governor didn't talk about religion as a pretext, his supporters routinely cite biblical justifications to stand against LGBT Americans.\n",

      "With passions inflamed around the country both for and against North Carolina's new law, a good question to ask might be: How many times does the bible mention transgender people and, more specifically, bathroom assignment?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there's certainly no specific mention of transgender people in the bible, the Old Testament seemingly takes a rough line on cross-dressing in the book of Deuteronomy 22:5. \"A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment, for all who do so an abomination to the Lord your God,\" the scripture reads. Though not specifically speaking of transgender individuals, it's hard to infer from this that the Bible would take a very woke position on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bible's tough stance on cross-dressing joins a litany of biblical, often Old Testament justice that is generally out of step with modern times. The Bible, for example, has no issue with slavery, and even comes with helpful tips for slave masters, and endorses polygamy (for men) and murdering your cheating spouse.\n",

      "Muslim citizens are as American as apple pie, a new poll says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey, from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, shows that though Muslims living in America are facing more violence than ever, they are actually among America's most model citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "What exactly does that mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, in a land founded on religious freedom, Muslims are among the most religious and patriotic citizens: 42% of Muslims attend services regularly compared to 45% of Protestants. And 87% of Muslims say religion is important to their lives, compared to 94% of Protestants.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Muslims would continue to show religious pride and attend service is a testament to their faith, especially when 2015 was the worst year for mosque attacks on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to identifying as a patriot, 85% of Muslims \"have a strong American identity,\" just like 84% of Protestants. They are also just as likely as other Americans to identify strongly with their faith — 89% of Muslims, 84% of Jews, and 95% of Catholics and Protestants shared the sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Republican presidential candidates continue to discuss \"radical Islamic terrorism\" in debates, most American Muslims actually reject violence by a much higher margin than other groups. Sixty-five percent of Muslims oppose the targeting and killing of civilians by military groups, much higher than other religious groups. Additionally, the survey found zero correlation between Muslim religious identity, mosque attendance and attitudes toward violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muslims make pretty great neighbors, too. Thirty-eight percent of Muslims work with neighbors to solve problems, almost equal to the percentage of Jews (40%) and Catholics (42%) who do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while a much lower number of Muslims are registered to vote, among those who are eligible and registered, 85% plan to vote (which is still lower than most groups.) However, given the Islamophobia in the current political climate, it's understandable. A combined 27% of non-voting Muslims said that they don't like the proposed candidates or the candidates don't represent them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, even though more than half of Muslims report experiencing discrimination on the basis of their religion in the last year — compared to 5% of Jews, 4% of Catholics and 2% of Protestants — they are the most optimistic about the future of America. Despite facing rampant Islamophobia, 63% of Muslims believe America is on the right track.\n",

      "Trans Girl's Anti-North Carolina Photo Goes Viral For All The Wrong Reasons\n",
      "Transgender activists have routinely pushed back on narratives that they say elevate individuals in their community who might \"pass\" for their preferred gender while marginalizing others whose self-presentation does not conform to the gender binary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to challenge the rigid way society views and classifies people by gender presentation, the thinking goes, we should seek to elevate trans people whose appearance reads neither as stereotypically male nor female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a case in point: On Tuesday, New Jersey-based Meg Bitton Photography agency posted a photo of Corey Maison, who is transgender and appears feminine — so much so that some commenters missed the point of the meme, thinking Maison was cisgender. The company posted the image to speak out North Carolina's HB2, which, among other things, prohibits municipalities in the state from adopting protections for trans folks who wish to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If this was YOUR daughter, would you be comfortable sending her into a men's bathroom?\" the photo's caption reads. \"'Neither would I. Be fair. Be kind. Be empathetic. Treat others how you would like to be treated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the meme is well-intentioned, it subtly reinforces the same prejudice it seeks to challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "For one thing, gender nonconformity isn't always as neatly presentable as Maison's photo suggests. By making Maison a poster child for the gender bathroom issue, the photo implies that society should be uncomfortable with people in bathrooms who don't read as men or women. But transgender individuals who don't \"pass\" are just as deserving of protection and media attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another variant of the pro-trans meme evinces the problem even more obviously. Take the photograph below of a transgender performer Kelly Lauren. Accompanying the image, in which Lauren presents herself as feminine, she asks: \"Houston, do you REALLY want me in the same restroom as your husband or boyfriend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We get the point, and Lauren is no doubt being cheeky. But encouraging opponents of LGBT rights to oppose bathroom bills because they feel uncomfortable with people of other genders using their restrooms misses the point. You don't fight prejudice with prejudice. It's akin to saying anti-gay lawmakers are gay themselves, reinforcing the idea that there's something wrong with being LGBT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of trans rights have posted images on social media depicting gender-nonconforming men or women as a scare tactic, which underscores the point: We should be as comfortable with people who look like the person in the photo below as we are, or should be, with Maison.\n",
      "\n",
      "A photo posted by (@) on\n",
      "\n",
      "Presenting people who appear gender nonconforming may stoke people's prejudices in the short term, but we should do it anyway. Eventually, the culture will learn to accept the diversity of the trans experience. A large part of the reason the LGBT movement has made so many inroads on gay rights is by pushing gay people and relationships into the spotlight. This may have made some opponents of LGBT rights think \"ick\" at first, but over time it served to humanize them and change public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"ick factor\" is what has led to a slate of anti-LGBT legislation. According to the Human Rights Campaign, there are nearly 200 proposed measures in 33 states so far this year that seek to restrict the rights and liberties of LGBT individuals, under the guise of so-called religious freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maison should not be forced into a bathroom where she in uncomfortable, and there is nothing wrong with her self-presentation. But the debate about who is impacted by anti-LGBT laws must remain inclusive to maximize impact from the advocacy.\n",

      "Then, Palin suggested candidates — though she didn't say who — were \"inducing\" and \"seducing\" immigrants with gift baskets. \"Come on over the border and here's a gift basket of teddy bears and soccer balls,\" she said mockingly.\n",

      "Florida native Mason Perkins sometimes feels a little unsafe using public mens restrooms — \"I usually go into the male one but I have to kind of hide my face,\" he said — so when he was in a Florida Target last week, he jumped at the opportunity to use a restroom that had been specifically designated as trans-inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was in the Target bathroom, Perkins snapped a selfie and uploaded it to Facebook with the pointed caption \"SHOUT OUT TO TARGET for letting me get up close and personal with their toilets, really enjoyed it, raped a total of zero children while pissing it was great 10/10 would piss again.\"\n",

      "\"When it first started, there were fewer than 10 cases and people were very afraid of it,\" said Consuelo Hylton, a 20-year-old student who knows someone currently quarantined, in a phone interview. (Hylton's sister Antonia also works at Mic.) \"Right after spring break, most students had given up and stopped thinking about it. At this point, it's kind of a joke. Most people say we're all gonna get mumps and then go off on summer break and spread it. But it's not really funny.\"\n",

That's a B+ at best, depending on the curve.\n",

      "What's most alarming now isn't how those first two students, an undergraduate and a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School, originally got mumps.

      "This Dad's Epic Takedown of Anti-Trans Bathroom Laws Is Going Viral\n",
      "Dad jokes may be groan-inducing, but it turns out dad takedowns are worthy of a standing ovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Dallas resident, and father of a 21-year-old daughter, posted a Facebook status on April 14 that, in the short time it's been on the social networking site, has garnered over 5,000 shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the post, Steven Rudner, who is the chair of Equality Texas' board of directors, spoke out against the recent wave of anti-transgender laws in the United States, most notably HB2 in North Carolina, which forces people to use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth, not their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the post, Rudner speaks candidly about the things that worry him when it comes to raising a daughter — one of which is not whether she uses the bathroom with transgender women.\n",
      "\n",
      "I worry about her being sexually assaulted, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of a drunk driver, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of gun violence, because lots of people die from gun-related injuries. Here's what I do not worry about: I don't worry about her being attacked in a restroom by a trans woman because (a) it has never happened; and (b) trans women are the most victimized group of people I've ever met, and the least likely to commit a crime of indecency in a restroom, because they are afraid of getting beat up when all they want to do is pee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner's post directly confronts the transgender bathroom predator myth, often the fuel behind anti-trans legislation. These myths persist despite zero recorded instances of a transgender person ever assaulting someone in a restroom. Conversely, many transgender and gender nonconforming people feel nervous using a restroom that does not match their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several individuals and businesses have spoken out against the laws since they were passed. Corporate giants like PayPal have moved business out of North Carolina, retailer Target has publicly stated that anyone can use the bathroom or fitting room of their choice and even a local Georgia Kroger put up a sign explaining why they have unisex bathrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commenters seem to love Rudner's logic and empathy. The post has been universally praised, including by openly gay Pennsylvania state representative Brian Sims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner ends his post by pointing out the need for kindness and acceptance toward trans people.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here is something else I don't worry about: I don't worry about my daughter being cruel and inhumane to trans men, women or kids, because my wife and I have raised her to have values and because she is a kind person. There are things to worry about. And then there are things people want you to worry about to conceal their agenda of discrimination and hate. Wake up.\n",

      "Newly released video shows precisely what happened during a 2013 incident in which Chicago police officers claimed a local reverend hit them with a car, eventually charging her with attempted murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video, courtesy of CBS Chicago, paints a much different picture of what happened to Rev. Catherine Brown, who is black, after her run-in with Officers Jose López and Michelle Morsi-Murphy on May 13, 2013. The clip reveals it was the officers' vehicle that caused the collision. Officers involved can clearly be seen laughing, hitting her car with a metal rod, drawing and pointing firearms, hitting her and using pepper spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to CBS Chicago, Brown said the beating was the result of a traffic dispute after the officers drove down an alleyway heading to her driveway. In her account, the officers immediately escalated what should have been an innocuous traffic maneuver into a full-on screaming match involving firearms and profanity. Brown attempted to drive away, but the driver of the Chicago police vehicle rammed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beat me down to my underwear, pulled my skirt off me,\" Brown told the station. \"They beat me with the sticks and hit me with their boots in my head.\"\n",

      "What if society treated consuming marijuana the same way we treat caffeine? Instead of starting off your Sunday morning with a cup of coffee, you'd pour a steamy weed-infused drink. Maybe when you're taking a walk through the park, that latte in your hand actually has a small dose of cannabis in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef Michael Cirino, who has a background in molecular gastronomy and food science, believes weed edibles will eventually transform our leisure time — if we can solve one big problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've ever tried weed edibles before, you know that getting the wrong dosage is an all-too-common issue. Often, you take too much or too little; a slightly too-big bite of chocolate can put you under the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cirino believes that by combining his cooking with scientific research, \"we can self-dose ourselves like we do with caffeine,\" he said during a cooking demonstration April 6 at the Brooklyn Kitchen in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a unique benefit to eating, rather than smoking, marijuana. When the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, is metabolized in the liver, it turns into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is supposedly more psychoactive. This gives weed edibles a demonstrably \"different\" high — longer, steadier, but not necessarily more intense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cirino's goal is to let people dose themselves to enjoy a steady high for a long period of time, as opposed to smoking a joint, whose high spikes and then falls away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the reason why many people who use marijuana medically prefer to eat it, according to the Daily Beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "But cooking with marijuana is intimidating — it's even produced a few horror stories. But proper knowledge of decarboxylation, or heating up the marijuana plant to activate its psychoactive delta 9-THC, can make it a more widely embraced practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decarboxylation can be done in an oven, pressure cooker or stovetop double boiler, according to Cirino. Then you can infuse the cannabinoids into a fat like butter or oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For proper dosing, Cirino recommends 1 gram of cannabis for every 20 to 25 grams of solvent for a cocktail-like strength, and 1 gram for every 30 to 50 grams solvent for a coffee-like strength. People should wait about one and a half to two hours to re-dose.\n",

      "Area 51, a U.S. governmental site located in Nevada, has inspired some grand theories regarding extraterrestrial life and UFOs for decades. And recently, the head administrator of the NASA confirmed the facility exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is an Area 51. It's not what many people think. I've been to a place called that but it's a normal research and development place,\" Charles Bolden, who has led NASA since 2009, said, according to the Telegraph. \"I never saw any aliens or alien spacecraft or anything when I was there. I think because of the secrecy of the aeronautics research that goes on there it's ripe for people to talk about aliens being there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why 7 Experts Are Convinced Alien Life Might Really Exist\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the head of NASA said that there is nothing strange about Area 51. Seems like an open and shut case. However, the former astronaut very clearly said that he \"never saw any aliens or alien space craft.\" It would appear that he could simply not be privy to the inner workings of Area 51.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former employee released \"secret\" Area 51 information. In 2014, a former scientist who claims to have worked within Area 51 named Boyd Bushman gave an interview with engineer Mark Patterson, just before he died. In the now-deleted video, Bushman claimed that he specialized in \"reverse-engineering alien UFO technology for the military,\" according to Tech Times. He also described the secret military base as hosting aliens, who come from the planet \"Quintumnia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are two groups of aliens. They divide them into two groups,\" the deceased scientist said in the interview, according to the NY Daily News. \"One group are wranglers, and the others are rustlers – the ones who are stealers of cattle. The two groups act differently. The ones that are wranglers are much more friendly, and have a better relationship with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While it is impossible for anyone to question Bushman now, there are claims the researcher's interview was all a hoax.\n",
      "\n",
      "A host of conspiracy theories: Even 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to get to the bottom of the Area 51 mystery. Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta has a strong interest in alien conspiracy theories, the Huffington Post reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much of an interest, in fact, that he spoke to Clinton about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has made me personally pledge we are going to get the information out,\" Clinton said, according to the Conway Daily Sun. \"One way or another. Maybe we could have, like, a task force to go to Area 51.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Podesta probably hopes to uncover the conspiracy theories that have surrounded the facility; one of the most popular being that Area 51 hides the remains of UFOs that crash-landed to Earth. Area 51 conspiracy theorists believe that scientists and researchers are recruited to the secret military base in order to reverse-engineer the extraterrestrial technology, and that the government is covering it all up. Other theories include fancier possibilities, like the creation of weather control technology, time travel and teleportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, the CIA confirmed the existence of Area 51, but made no mention about any grand conspiracy theories regarding aliens or UFOs, according to CNN. The released document instead confirmed that the secret military base is \"a testing site for the government's U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs.\"\n",

      "If you encourage someone to end their life by suicide, or neglect to stop them going through with it, are you inherently implicated for their death? Michelle Carter, who encouraged her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to kill himself, is at the center of an involuntary manslaughter charge over his 2014 death and could face up to 20 years of imprisonment if convicted.

      "\n",
      "Roy and Carter had met each other in Florida, though their two-year relationship was mostly over the phone. Roy had social anxiety and was severely depressed, according to Boston.com. Carter, who was also afflicted with an eating disorder, dissuaded Roy from seeking help during the days prior to his death, and proposed that he \"just do it,\" instead of belaboring and talking about killing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defense's argument: Carter's attorney, Joseph Cataldo argues that Carter's actions didn't constitute serious bodily harm, arguing that Roy's decision to end his life by suicide had already been made through his own volition.\n",

      "\"All [Carter] did is talk to someone,\" Cataldo said, according to Boston.com. \"[Roy] got the generator. He took all the necessary steps ...

      "Carter is being charged as a youthful offender, and the result of her trial can have longterm ramifications in future decisions and prosecutions, even in lesser cases.

      "Can Science Explain Noah's Ark? Why Logic Thoroughly Debunks the Biblical Story\n",
      "The Bible is filled with impossible phenomena, but one that has constantly been imitated in pop culture and discussed in the scientific community is the believability of Noah's Ark. The purported ark would have been able to hold two of every animal on board, and that's obviously a ton of space. However, there are some merits for the plausible existence of the ark, as well as overwhelming evidence to suggest it would've been an impossible creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're gonna need a bigger boat: One of the biggest issues with Noah's Ark would have been the wide selection of animals aboard the boat. According to the Bible, you have the likes of lions and llamas, heavy animals but nothing too crazy. However, when factoring in the likes of dinosaurs, which would have been on the ship as well (Some Creationists will agree dinosaurs did exist, somehow to fit within the 6,000 year existence of Earth according to Genesis), the weight would've been too much to sustain. Not to mention, you'd have eight people on board to take care of all these animals — no easy task.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That would mean, for example, the brachiosaurus (two of them, of course), each of which weighed about 50 tons and reached 85 feet (26 meters) long,\" Benjamin Radford wrote for LiveScience. \"Even if two representatives all of Earth's animals could somehow fit on the ark, enough space would be needed for drinking water and food for an entire year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Russell Crowe certainly made it look doable in Noah.\n",
      "\n",
      "It just had to float, doe: It's important to remember that the ark wouldn't have needed to be steered anywhere; it was merely going to withstand the flood. With that in mind, postgraduate physics students at the University of Leicester confirmed through their metrics that the boat would have remained afloat, based on how big it would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the study, with the approximate ark measurement of 472 feet, it would have been able to hold up to 70,000 animals on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't think of the Bible necessarily as a scientifically accurate source of information, so I guess we were quite surprised when we discovered it would work,\" student Thomas Morris said in an interview with the Independent. \"We're not proving that it's true, but the concept would definitely work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, until you consider that a recent scientific study posited that there are 6.5 million different species of land animals on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Bill Nye isn't convinced: The Science Guy is willing to shut down any discussions about the feasibility of the ark, however — and he certainly has the credentials to do so. During his widely publicized debate against creationist Ken Ham at the Creation Museum in Kentucky, the nearly three-hour long debate eventually moved to the subject of Noah's Ark.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Noah himself, Nye questioned his craftsmanship and ability to create such a vessel, particularly when he had to house so many animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it reasonable that Noah and his family were able to maintain 14,000 animals and themselves on a ship ... that was bigger than anyone's been able to build?\" Nye questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it turns out some people still think it's reasonable. Despite this takedown from the acclaimed scientist, the subject actually sparked additional funding for the museum's Noah's Ark Encounter project, which will create a life-sized replica of the ark housed at the museum. With that extra funding, the boat is expected to be completed in the summer of 2016, and will eventually feature a zoo to accompany it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, our gut is to go with what Nye thinks, and that means the story of Noah's Ark is just that: a story.\n"

      "5 Everyday Phrases That Actually Have Racist Origins\n",
      "As the years go by, certain words and phrases take on new meanings. But some seemingly harmless terms actually stem from hurtful, racist origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Understanding where these words and phrases come from is an important part of understanding how racism and oppression have shaped the world we live in today,\" Francesca Ramsey, host of the weekly MTV series Decoded, said of these secretly racist phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the terms have different meanings today, society should at the very least know the origins of these common phrases that frequently pop up in casual conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long Time, No See\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually meant as a greeting when someone sees a person they have not seen in a long time, the phrase \"long time, no see\" stems from other origins. The phrase was once used to make fun of Native Americans and their use of the English language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another phrase imitative of the syntax of pidgin English, long time no see was originally meant as a humorous interpretation of a Native American greeting, used after a prolonged separation,\" according to the Oxford Dictionaries blog. \"The current earliest citation recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) comes from W.F. Drannan's book Thirty-one Years on Plains (1901): 'When we rode up to him [sc. an American Indian] he said: 'Good mornin. Long time no see you.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thug\n",
      "\n",
      "The word thug, which is often used synonymously with the words \"gangster\" or \"criminal,\" is sometimes used to refer to black Americans unfairly. The use of the word spiked during the Baltimore riots, despite the true origins of the word having nothing to do with blacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As far as I can tell, thug goes back to the 14th Century,\" Megan Garber wrote in her piece \"The History of 'Thug'\" for the Atlantic. She noted that the term likely traces back to an India-based network of criminals that existed for centuries called the Thuggee, who were so feared that even Mark Twain wrote of their exploits in his book Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Itis\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The itis\" is used to describe that lethargic, sleepy feeling an individual gets after eating a large meal. However, the phrase originates from the word \"niggeritis,\" which helped reinforce the stereotype that black Americans were lazy. The scientific term for the phenomenon is referred to as postprandial sleepiness, or somnolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call a Spade a Spade\n",
      "\n",
      "The origin of the phrase \"call a spade a spade\" is a little more unclear. According to NPR, it may be an evolved form of the saying \"to call a fig a fig and a trough a trough,\" which was used in ancient Greece.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the phrase took on a new meaning when people started using the word \"spade\" to refer to black Americans. According to the Huffington Post, use of the word \"spade\" gradually became a racist word to describe blacks.\n",

Judge Chun's sentencing decision today is an insult to Akai Gurley, his family, and all victims of police violence. Any amount of jail/prison time is a brief snippet of time compared to the lifetime Akai Gurley's young daughters will have to live without their father. The sentencing sends the message that it is okay to kill innocent and precious lives, as long as it is done by a police officer.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Tubman, an escaped slave who helped so many others to freedom that she was known in her own lifetime as \"Moses,\" has long been sought by activists looking to oust Jackson, whose most famous accomplishments included the forced relocation of Native Americans (known as the Trail of Tears) and destroying the country's Second National Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When we make such a dramatic change to something no one ever looks at, we have to consider the fragile feelings of white men,\" said Bee, before pivoting. \"Where on earth could I find a white man sharing his feelings?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee turned to perennial liberal punching-bag Fox News and specifically Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade, who had mounted a defense of Jackson last week on his show. \"Ousting a past president who has done so much in the founding of our country,\" Kilmeade admonished, would be an \"unbelievable sign of disrespect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Jackson did participate in the American revolution, he played no role in the founding events of the United States. \"He was not a Founding Father,\" said Bee. \"He was a genocidal prick who forced the relocation of nonwhites and fomented populist rebellion — kind of like a Trump with better hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee closed out the sketch with an exploration of other ideas like former presidential candidate, Dr. Ben Carson's suggestion that Tubman be placed on the $2 bill or even more radical ideas that a new bill be created for her like the $25 or $12 bill.\n",
      "\n",

      "A statewide ban on same-sex couples adopting children in Mississippi was declared unconstitutional Thursday by a federal judge, the Associated Press reported. Mississippi was the last state in the United States to have a ban on adoption by same-sex couples.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan cited the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling in his decision. \"It also seems highly unlikely that the same court that held a state cannot ban gay marriage because it would deny benefits — expressly including the right to adopt — would then conclude that married gay couples can be denied that very same benefit,\" he wrote.\n",

      "Jordan ordered John Davis, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, to stop enforcing the ban, effectively opening the door for LGBT couples to file adoption paperwork as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal challenge to the ban came from four couples who filed a lawsuit in 2015, joined by the Campaign for Southern Equality and the Family Equality Council, seeking to overturn it, the New York Times reported. One of the couples who sued, Kathryn Garner and Susan Hrostowski, have been together for more than 25 years and have a 16-year-old son, Hudson.\n",

      "A driver trying to attain a high speed on Snapchat is allegedly to blame for a car accident outside of Atlanta, Georgia, that left a victim with \"traumatic brain injuries,\" CNN reported.\n",

      "The driver, Christal McGee, was driving 107 mph at the time of the collision on September 10, 2015, going over the speed limit \"in order to obtain recognition through Snapchat by means of a Snapchat 'trophy'\", according to the issued complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a statement from the law offices of Michael Lawson Neff, McGee said she was \"Just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat.\"\n",

New evidence also points to Snapchat as the possible cause of a car crash in Philadelphia that left three young women dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint issued against McGee also cites an accident in Brazil in which a woman wrecked her car while documenting herself driving 110 mph on Snapchat. The woman snapped a photo of the speedometer prior to the collision with the caption \"180 KM LMAO\" — 180 kilometers per hour equates to 112 miles per hour, just five miles more than the speed McGee was driving when she hit Wentworth's car. The woman in Brazil continued to snap the accident following the impact, posting bloody selfies with the captions translating to \"HELLLLLLLLLPPP\" and \"we overturned the car\".\n",
      "\n",
      "McGee also took a Snapchat following her accident, according to Peagler's statement, snapping a photo of herself in the ambulance with blood on her face with the text, \"Lucky to be alive.\"\n",

      "You've been warned: It's no wonder injury attorneys are warning parents about the dangers of Snapchat's speed filter and Facebook groups like Mothers Against Snapchatting While Driving are being created. There are also some grim anti-snapchat-while-driving ads, showing users the deadly consequences of snapping behind the wheel.\n",

      "After Beyoncé unleashed Lemonade to the world, unloading a concoction of underlying political and sometimes controversial themes, no other line has been as much a catalyst for scandal as \"He better call Becky with the good hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several celebrities have come out in their own defense to reassure fans and the furiously buzzing BeyHive they are not, in fact, the cheating Becky, including fashion designer Rachel Roy, singer Rita Ora and even chef Rachel Ray (who unveiled a lemonade recipe after the implosion).\n",
      "\n",
      "But on Tuesday morning, TV personality Wendy Williams took the term to task: \"Calling a white girl Becky, I have decided — hi, white people — that is not very nice. That's like calling a black girl 'Shaniqua,'\" Williams said. The daytime talk show host then proceeded to call her off-camera producer Susanne \"Becky,\" acknowledging the two use the phrase casually off camera. \"I am not using that word anymore, today is the last day I'll use it, and I encourage everyone else, don't call white girls 'Becky,' that is very hurtful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Becky\" isn't a racial slur. It's always unacceptable for anyone to use a derogatory term to undermine someone based on their skin color — even for Beyoncé. But the name \"Becky\" itself is categorically not a derogatory term for whites— it's a name popularized in pop culture and society to describe someone as \"basic,\" regardless of their skin color. Beyoncé injecting the reference in a song about being cheated on by Jay Z with another woman, and calling that woman Becky, doesn't immediately imply a white woman slept with her husband, but instead, someone she sees as beneath her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"Becky\" has taken on several meanings. Sir Mix-a-Lot popularized the Becky reference in the early '90s in the intro to his critical hit \"Baby Got Back,\" in which two disapproving women can be heard critiquing another woman's figure and style. The term has since been used to describe a multitude of meanings, from suburban yuppies, according to Online Slang Dictionary, to a woman who performs oral sex well.\n",
      "\n",

      "Two years after killing 68-year-old Ernest Satterwhite in North Augusta, South Carolina, here's the punishment Justin Gregory Craven is facing today: three years of probation, 80 days of community service, no jail time and a pretty sweet life ahead of him, considering the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We couldn't ask for a better outcome as far as the sentence is concerned,\" Jack Swerling, Craven's attorney, told reporters Monday, according to Reuters. \"[He] got probation, no house arrest and he's pretty much free to go live his life.\"\n",

      "Satterwhite died at a hospital, and Craven was charged with discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle in April 2015 — the same day Michael Slager was charged with murder for shooting Walter Scott, another unarmed black man, two hours east in North Charleston, according to the Washington Post.\n",

      "With Republicans embroiled in a civil war over the likely nomination of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz — both scorched-earth outsiders loathed by much of the GOP establishment — Elizabeth Warren has a message for the party: You brought this on yourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Republicans painted themselves into this corner,\" the Democratic senator from Massachusetts wrote in a Friday op-ed for the Boston Globe. Trump and Cruz, Warren argued, are \"logical outgrowths\" of the GOP's years-long strategy of obstructionism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest case study, Warren observed, is the Senate GOP's refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In nominating Garland, \"[t]he president has done his job, as directed by our Constitution — but Republican senators refuse to do theirs,\" Warren wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Barack Obama won two consecutive elections and has been president for seven years. But since the first day of his presidency, Republican leaders have rejected his legitimacy and abused the rules of the Senate in an all-out effort to cripple the government under his leadership,\" she contended, citing \"artificial debt ceiling crises, deliberate government shutdowns and intentional confirmation blockades.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this have to do with two leading Republican candidates?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are the next logical outgrowth of the same attitude — if you can't get what you want, just ignore the obligations of governing, then divert attention and responsibility by wallowing in a toxic stew of attacks on Muslims, women, Latinos, and each other,\" Warren wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attack dog: Though Warren resisted calls to enter the presidential fray herself, she has become increasingly engaged in the 2016 campaign, even as she has pointedly refused to endorse either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The populist scourge of big banks and their political benefactors is now directing much of her ire at Republicans — particularly Trump. She's lately taken to calling the billionaire businessman a \"loser,\" appropriating one of his signature insults, and has linked Trump to \"history's worst authoritarians.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversial Republican frontrunner \"stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors,\" she wrote in a recent tweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Democrats grow uneasy over the acrimonious primary between Clinton and Sanders — fearing that it may weaken the party against the GOP — Warren's decision to keep the heat on the opposition may prove just as crucial as an endorsement.\n",
      "George Takei to Bernie Sanders Supporters: It's Over, Come Back to Hillary Clinton\n",

      "Takei was adamant that, even though he had felt the Bern during the campaign, it was important to ultimately coalesce around Clinton. \"Having been through many bruising primaries in my life, I'm also a realist,\" said a stern Takei. \"From where I sit, the math is clear. Hillary likely will win and she will be our nominee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The former Star Trek star-turned-millennial-icon said that even though Sanders would likely not receive the nomination, he had already won a victory — of sorts — by energizing the Democratic electorate during what he called a \"historic\" nomination fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked for a pledge — no, not the Donald Trump kind of pledge — from supporters to \"vote blue, no matter who.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "... and yes, it came with its own hashtag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takei said Clinton and Sanders supporters were members of the same family and that families \"come together when threatened.\" He then listed a litany of issues which the two agree on, including, expanding the Affordable Care Act, protecting abortion rights and raising the minimum wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bernie himself has said that, 'On her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day.'\" Takei noted. \"If Bernie believes that, his supporters can too.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "4 Mysteries From Ancient Egypt We Still Can't Figure Out\n",
      "The Ancient Egyptians ruled a significant chunk of the world for almost 3,000 years, and left behind a rich legacy of art, architecture and mythology. But Ancient Egypt also left behind a few mysteries that archeologists and scholars still haven't been able to solve, even thousands of years later. Here are some of the enduring mysteries of Ancient Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What did ancient Egyptians look like?\n",
      "\n",
      "AP White actress Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the mummies, statues and engravings that the ancient Egyptians left behind, there is still much controversy over just what, exactly, they looked like. One thing's for certain though — despite what you might believe about them given Hollywood's whitewashing of Egyptians, the residents of ancient Egypt weren't white.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Slate, they were probably a range of colors, and \"neither white nor black\" by our contemporary understandings: \"Ancient Egypt was a racially diverse place, because the Nile River drew people from all over the region. Egyptian writings do not suggest that the people of that era had a preoccupation with skin color. Those who obeyed the king, spoke the language, and worshipped the proper gods were considered Egyptian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How were the pyramids built?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancient Egypt's massive pyramids are another element of their legacy that has long puzzled the experts. Just how, exactly, did a society with no modern construction equipment manage to transport the giant, heavy stones needed to build the enormous pyramids? According to recent research by physicists at the University of Amsterdam, part of the answer may be wet sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It turns out that wetting Egyptian desert sand can reduce the friction by quite a bit, which implies you need only half of the people to pull a sledge on wet sand, compared to dry sand,\" study lead author Daniel Bonn told LiveScience. An ancient wall painting also seems to depict Egyptians wetting the sand as they pulled a sledge bearing a giant statue, offering more evidence that water may have been part of the arduous and complicated process of building the ancient pyramids.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. How did King Tut die?\n",
      "\n",
      "The young King Tutankhamun has fascinated historians since his tomb was discovered in 1922, but the specifics of his life — and death at the age of 19 — remain somewhat of a mystery. A longstanding theory that he died in a chariot crash was seemingly debunked when scans of his mummified body revealed that he had a \"partially clubbed foot\" that would have made it impossible for him to stand on his own, reported the Independent in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new research also revealed, through genetic analysis, that Tutankhamun's parents were likely brother and sister, and he may have died \"as a result of genetic impairments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. What's hidden inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Khufu pyramid, the largest of the three pyramids at Giza, may actually contain some hidden secrets. A 2015 thermal scan of the Great Pyramid indicated that there were \"thermal anomalies\" within the structure, reports the Guardian, though it's unclear what, exactly, that might mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "A statement released about the results of the scans said the anomalies could mean many things: \"To explain such anomalies a lot of hypothesis and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents,\" reported the Guardian. There could even be an as-yet-undiscovered hidden tomb, but the project, which is expected to last through the end of 2016, hasn't drawn any conclusions yet.\n"

      "Oklahoma Republican Apologizes for Saying Native Americans Are Predisposed to Alcoholism\n",
      "Oklahoma state Rep. Todd Russ, a Republican, stepped in a steaming pile of controversy last week when he claimed that Native Americans are \"predisposed to alcoholism\" and would be disproportionately impacted by laws expanding liquor sales in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The representative's suggestion that Native Americans \"process alcohol differently\" came during a debate on the House floor about a proposed change to the state constitution that would allow wine and full-strength beer to be sold in convenience stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russ apologized for his comments in an email to Indian Country Today Media Network on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I apologize for the unintended pain I have caused Native Americans by my statement that was based upon outdated information,\" he wrote. \"I hope this misstatement has opened the dialogue that ensures the most accurate and current information is communicated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Garett Fisbeck/AP Oklahoma House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "An overwhelming body of research repudiates Russ' original claim. One study published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found no correlation between alcohol abuse among Native Americans and how their bodies process alcohol. Another from the New England Journal of Medicine drew a similar conclusion, finding that whites and Native Americans metabolize alcohol similarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the myth persists nonetheless. \"It's easier to pathologize people than it is to think critically,\" Jessica Elm, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington who studies Native American health, told the Verge in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true, however, that Native Americans are significantly more likely to die of alcohol-related causes — for instance, traffic deaths and liver disease — than other groups. But this isn't because they are genetically predisposed to alcoholism. Public health researchers have linked high alcohol abuse among Native Americans to a variety of factors, including high rates of depression — Native American youth have the highest suicide rates in the nation among those of the same age — and endemic poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But instead of treating this as a public health problem and seeking ways to address it, lawmakers like Russ pathologize Native American people themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help address this public health problem, policymakers must ensure Native American communities have the resources to treat substance abuse and underlying mental health issues. But even that may fall short of addressing the root of the problem, which stems from social forces that require systemic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a transcript of Russ' full apology:\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize for the unintended pain I have caused Native Americans by my statement that was based upon outdated information. I hope this misstatement has opened the dialogue that ensures the most accurate and current information is communicated. Opportunities to be more informed are welcomed as it gives me the knowledge to make the most educated decisions when I vote for legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Substance abuse has no preference of race, gender, ethnicity, religion or socioeconomic status. I have been personally affected by the misery caused from substance abuse by loved one's myself. As a young boy, I witnessed the sadness of alcoholism with my Grandfather whom I loved dearly. As a result of my own family's predisposition to alcoholism, I latter [sic] witnessed the direct and indirect effects of alcohol on four of my five siblings. Unfortunate choices that started with alcohol bombarded those I loved the most. I am sad to say that we have since buried two of my younger brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My life has been ripped and torn and broken from the dark nature of alcohol from my childhood. Because of my personal experiences, I am passionate about derailing efforts of the intoxicating liquor and wine industries to make alcohol even more readily available with fewer restrictions. In my concern for the unsuspecting public and other social groups, I let my emotions cloud my thoughts and words. I am very sorry and truly meant no hurt or harm.\n",

      "Harnessing the the ocean to produce usable power is the mission of alternative energy company Wavestar. The Denmark company has been working on its \"big ocean\" commercial 1 megawatt machine for a 2017 release, according to its website. The machine seeks to tap into the frontier of the renewable and limitless energy of wave power. The rise in development and adoption of wave power often draws comparisons to that of wind power, according to Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could say that in the long run it's necessary that we go from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy — it's what we have to do to help protect the environment, look after our earth and it would be good for all mankind,\" Wavestar co-founder Niels Hansen said in a video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using its 20 floaters, which bounce with the movement of waves, the 1 megawatt machine would transfer kinetic wave energy through hydraulics to turn and power a generator, according to Tidal Energy Today. One day, the goal is to increase the output of each machine to 6 megawatts, enough for one machine to power up to 4,000 homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of tidal power can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when people used the moon's power to help grind grain, according to GE Reports. One of the benefits of tidal power is the fact that it's cyclical and predictable, so people know how much power is coming and when. It's also more powerful than wind, since waves are 800 times denser than air, according to Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "To handle the higher density of water, Wavestar's machine would also be able to seamlessly adapt to weather and wave conditions, also lifting up its floaters when it's too stormy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While out sailing by theirs parents' beach house in 2000, Niels and Keld Hansen brainstormed the idea of harnessing wave energy, buying the rights to a machine in 2003, according to the Wavestar website. The first tank testing went underway in 2004 at Aalborg University. Since then, the company has been testing larger scales of the machine and new power take-off systems, according to Tidal Energy Today.\n",

      "Meet Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, Vietnam's first female self-made billionaire. Much of her net worth comes from her company VietJet Air, which on its website calls itself a \"dynamic, innovative airline.\" But some might have other words for what it is her company is doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, VietJet isn't known so much for its CEO as it is its bikinied flight attendants. It's a uniform Thao insists is empowering for women in such a conservative country.\n",

      "\"As a businesswoman, I have a responsibility to contribute to the economy and to push for positive changes of the country and in the society, in light of the international integration that's happening,\" Thao told Bloomberg.\n",

      "New Racist Texts Show San Francisco Officers Joking About \"Slave Ships\" And Ferguson\n",
      "San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr announced Friday that all officers on the city's force would undergo anti-harassment training after he released a transcript of racist and homophobic text messages sent among officers about suspects and citizens in the city. The latest batch of offensive exchanges comes days after authorities confirmed the authenticity of an older series of messages released by a city attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can only hope the anti-harassment class will discourage police officers from referring to the citizens they are sworn to protect and serve as n****** and \"beaners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The newly released texts show the officers denigrating black and Latino suspects with racial slurs and insulting fellow officers whom they perceived to be gay. The texts also include conversations ridiculing the black community in Ferguson, Missouri, where police fatally shot an unarmed black man in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "One multimedia message includes a photo of smoke rising above San Francisco. Officers guessed the cause of the fire, the AP reported: \"Must be Korean BBQ,\" reads one text message. \"I heard was a slave ship!!\" another reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities investigating sexual-assault allegations against a former officer said they found the text messages on two officers' personal phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suhr detailed steps he's taking to combat bias in the department, which include making the force as diverse as San Francisco's population of more than 837,000. Ed Lee, the city's first Chinese-American mayor, emailed every officer in the force on Thursday urging him or her to report colleagues who exhibit biased or racist behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suhr, who has been embroiled in a scandal over an alleged culture of racial bias and brutality in the department since 2014, previously stated that the text messages aren't proof that racist attitudes are deeply rooted in the force of 2,100 officers. The scandal helped to flare tensions with the black community in December, when officers fatally shot Mario Woods, a 26-year-old African-American who was wielding a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mere existence of the texts left some officers feeling betrayed, as most on the force felt unfairly associated with the bias allegation, Suhr said. \"The vast majority of police officers are shaken,\" he said. \"The expectations [of professional conduct] have never been higher, so when officers do something like this, the disappointment can't be greater.\"\n"

      "McLean denied defacing the sign at first, but police caught her with black spray paint on her hands.\n",

      "As the world continues to reel from the fallout of the Panama Papers revelation, video has emerged showing that Bernie Sanders may have called the whole thing back in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October of that year, Sanders took to the Senate floor to raise questions about the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement, which he said was little more than a giveaway to large corporations and wealthy Americans looking to hide their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens,\" he said. \"The Panama Free Trade Agreement would make this situation much worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, at least 200 U.S. passport holders have been connected to the Panama Papers, with much data still to be analyzed, McClatchyDC reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite Sanders' warning, the free trade agreement with Panama went forward with the support of President Obama — and his secretary of state, Sanders' current Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama's move to pass what had been a stalled Bush-era free trade pact was a sharp departure for a president who rode to office partly on a promise to make existing trade agreements more equitable.

      "Researchers have obtained the most accurate measurement yet of how quickly the universe is expanding — and it's not what they were expecting to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "The universe is expanding about 8% faster than predicted, according to a new study published on the preprint server arXiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the results are confirmed, it could transform our understanding of dark matter and dark energy, and completely change our understanding of cosmology itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that there is something in the standard cosmological model that we don't understand,\" Adam Riess, co-discoverer of dark energy and lead author on the new paper, told Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cosmological mystery: Cosmologists believe dark matter is an invisible material that makes up 27% of the universe, while visible matter only makes up 5%. The fact that we can measure dark matter's gravitational pull suggests that it exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark energy makes up the other 68% of the universe. It's an unknown force that cosmologists think is accelerating the expansion of the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cosmologists think dark matter puts the breaks on expansion, while dark energy accelerates it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of what we know about dark matter, dark energy and the universe's expansion is based on our observations of radiation left over from the Big Bang called the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, scientists put together the most detailed maps of the CMB we've ever had. Think of the maps as the baby pictures of our universe. Based on those baby pictures, scientists can predict how our universe expanded and evolved — and what its current rate of expansion should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem? The latest measurements in this study don't match those predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA Image of the cosmic microwave background\n",
      "\n",
      "Reiss and his team measured the expansion of the universe by studying certain types of celestial objects, like stars and supernovae, known as \"standard candles.\" Standard candles are thought to all be the same level of brightness, so astronomers can use them as distance markers to measure how fast the universe is expanding away from us. If this new measurement is accurate — and our maps of the CMB are also accurate — then something about our fundamental understanding of the universe is wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers have possible explanations. Dark matter might have some property that we don't know about that's driving expansion. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy is that dark energy has simply gotten stronger over time, and sped up the universe's expansion rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, it might be that our way of measuring expansion isn't very accurate. Cosmologists rely on standard candles to tell them how quickly objects are moving away from us, but there's a growing body of evidence that these candles might not be so standard after all, and therefore not an accurate measurement of the rate of expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll have to wait and see if the new study holds up. If it does, cosmology as we know it may need a big overhaul.\n",

      "Ahhh college ... the keggers, late nights at the library, dining hall food and, um, paralyzing tuition payments? The average cost of a four-year college education in the U.S. varies depending on the type of school, but no matter where you go, it will probably cost you a pretty penny: The College Board puts the yearly average tuition at a four-year public college at $9,139 for in-state students and $22,958 for out-of-state students, while average yearly tuition at a private college is $31,231.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter what type of school you attend, the costs can add up quickly. According to the College Board's estimates, even if tuition rates didn't go up during your four years of school, a degree can cost you anywhere between $36,556 and $124,924.\n",
      "\n",
      "And remember, tuition and fees don't necessarily include additional costs like housing, meals and books, so real costs may be even higher. In 2015, Forbes reported that the average cost of college was more than $28,000 a year at a four-year public college and more than $59,000 at a private college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps due to the current, costly state of higher education, more college graduates than ever are leaving school with debt. According to the Wall Street Journal, the class of 2015 was the most indebted in history, leaving school with an average of $35,000 in student loan debt, and, in the U.S. today, \"Almost 71% of bachelor's degree recipients will graduate with a student loan, compared with less than half two decades ago and about 64% 10 years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scariest thing about tuition costs in the U.S. might not be how much they are now — but how much they're going to be in a few years. According to Forbes, \"the projected cost of an elite college from 2018 — 2021 could soar as high as $334,000 for a four-year degree.\"\n",

      "Get the five stories that will challenge you to rethink the world by signing up for MicCheck Daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texas dad Steve Rudner's Facebook post about his daughter is going viral — for all the right reasons. On Thursday, Rudner, a lawyer in Dallas, posted about his fears for his 21-year-old daughter. \"I worry about her being sexually assaulted, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of a drunk driver, because that happens a lot. I worry about her being the victim of gun violence, because lots of people die from gun-related injuries,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing Rudner isn't worried about? His daughter sharing a bathroom with trans women: \"Here's what I do not worry about: I don't worry about her being attacked in a restroom by a trans woman because (a) it has never happened; and (b) trans women are the most victimized group of people I've ever met, and the least likely to commit a crime of indecency in a restroom, because they are afraid of getting beat up when all they want to do is pee.\" Preach, man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudner's Facebook post is a clear response to the so-called \"religious freedom bills\" proposed in several states and passed in North Carolina and Mississippi that either publicly or privately limit trans people from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities. Supporters of the legislation have argued that such measures are necessary to protect children, but, as Rudner points out in his epic Facebook post, children being in danger because they share a bathroom with a trans person just isn't a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, such laws would only make things harder for trans people, who already experience a disproportionate amount of violence. Rudner's post is clearly speaking to many who agree with him: It's been shared more than a thousand times and was reposted on a Facebook page called \"Living Blue in Texas.\"\n",

      "In December, Police Chief Greg Suhr beat back activists' claims that racist attitudes in the department were deeply rooted after a police officer fatally shot Mario Woods, a 26-year-old African-American who was wielding a knife, in front of several witnesses. Lai's texts, however, are counter to Suhr's statement that he'd rooted out the bad apples in the department.\n",

      "Lai's involvement in the texting scandal comes after Asian-American activists across the country sought to speak out against real and perceived racism within their community.

      "Racist Biological Myths About Black People Believed by Half of UVA Med Students — Cool!\n",
      "Racial bias has always been a serious threat to the health of minority populations. Police brutality and the Flint Water Crisis exemplify how institutional racism becomes a matter of life and death as well as a danger to people of color's overall wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a recent study from the University of Virginia shows these racial biases may follow black people right into the doctor's office.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the university's press release, Kelly Hoffman, a psychology Ph.D. candidate, asked 222 white medical students and residents to evaluate two mock cases and treat two fictional patients — one white, one black — for each. Hoffman had the study's participants prescribe pain treatments based on how much pain they believed the patients experienced, and they ended up revealing a major prejudice.\n",

      "Read more: 6 Actual Facts Show Why Mental Health Is an Issue in the Black Community\n",
      "\n",
      "When Hoffman asked whether the UVA med students believed racist myths such as that black people age slower than whites, that their nerve endings are less sensitive than white and that their skin is thicker than white people's, half of them said yes to at least one of the myths. What's more, she found that the same people who endorsed these biological myths were more likely to report lower pain ratings for their black patient and therefore provide less accurate treatment for those patients.\n",

      "\"What's so striking is that, today, these beliefs are not necessarily related to individual prejudice,\" said Hoffman. \"Many people who reject stereotyping and prejudice nonetheless believe in these biological differences.

      "23 Reasons Why We Definitely Don't Need Any Gun Safety Reforms Ever\n",
      "A 2-year-old boy picked up a gun and shot and killed his mother from the backseat of a car in Milwaukee on Wednesday, the Guardian reported. According to the Washington Post, it's just one of nearly two dozen such incidents this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Jan. 1, the Post found, there have been an astonishing 23 incidents in which a toddler picked up a gun, fired it, and hit someone — in 18 cases, the victim was the toddler, though in five, it was a bystander. In one incident in March, the victim was a Florida gun rights activist, Jamie Gilt, who posted a meme saying \"my right to protect my child with my gun trumps your fear of my gun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sad that this is even a thing. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/01/toddlers-have-shot-at-least-23-people-this-year/ ...pic.twitter.com/OOlfMos8tx\n",
      "\n",
      "While toddler-involved shootings are perhaps the most egregious gun incidents, their older brothers and sisters are pulling their weight as well. At least 77 people aged 17 or younger have shot someone with a firearm this year as of April 26, according to pro-gun control group Everytown For Gun Safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Post, shootings involving toddlers are disproportionately located in gun-friendly states including Georgia, Florida, Missouri and Texas, as well as Michigan, which has a major gun problem in the metro Detroit region. This follows a well-established pattern of gun violence in which states with looser gun laws tend to have more gun-related injuries and deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such disasters result in hundreds of child fatalities and have made American children nine times more likely to die in gun accidents than children anywhere else in the developed world,\" wrote the Post's Nathan J. Robinson. \"They demonstrate fairly conclusively that guns cannot be both safe and ubiquitous; the inevitable consequence of widespread gun ownership is a never-ending series of tragedies involving children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet the prevailing attitude appears to be that even talk of basic responsible ownership is for wusses and Constitution-haters,\" he added. \"The NRA has waged all-out war against pediatricians and the CDC for recommending gun safety to parents, lobbying hard for laws to prohibit doctors from even discussing firearms risks with families.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, there's absolutely no telling whether those 23 gun-toting toddlers were just watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants. Or guns don't kill toddlers, toddlers kill toddlers. The only thing that can stop a bad toddler with a gun is a good toddler with a gun. Etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rinse and repeat, because if the U.S. is good at one thing, it's justifying entirely preventable and extremely widespread death, maiming and heartbreak from firearms with folksy maxims about gun rights and liberty.\n",
      "Ancient Stone Depicting First Female Egyptian Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut Discovered\n",
      "Ancient inscribed stone blocks containing information about Egypt's long-lost and first female pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut — who ruled from 1473 B.C. to 1458 B.C. — have been uncovered on Egypt's Elphantine Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than being just one of about two or three female pharaohs in Egypt's history, Queen Hatshepsut was also a builder, and the blocks are presumed to be from one of her buildings that was recently discovered. The building, which was found by the German Archaeological Institute, is believed to be a way station for the god Khnum, according to a Facebook statement by the Ministry of Antiquities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the pillars are representations of several versions of the god Khnum, as well as other gods, such as Imi-peref 'He-who-is-in-his-house,' Nebet-menit 'Lady-of-the-mooring-post' and Min-Amun of Nubia,\" the Ministry of Antiquities wrote. \"The building thus not only adds to our knowledge of the history of Queen Hatshepsut, but also to our understanding of the religious beliefs current on the Island of Elephantine during her reign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Queen Hatshepsut stepped into her reign at the age of 12 years old when she wed her half-brother Thutmose II. Thutmose II died at a young age, and Hatshepsut became a guide for Thutmose III before assuming the role herself, possibly because of political threats. To keep her legitimacy as a fit ruler and not just a \"great wife\" of the king, Hatshepsut had to reinvent herself as a man. (The blocks refer to Queen Hatshepsut as a woman, which indicates that they're probably from the beginning of her reign, as she was referred to as a male later on.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In her reign, she brought wealth through a successful trade expedition and grand building projects. After her death, Thutmose III erased almost all remnants of Hatshepsut, including her buildings and images. Scholars didn't learn of her existence until 1822.\n"

During that time, they planted an American flag, collected about 50 pounds of moon rocks and soil, set up a seismometer to measure any lunar quakes, collected gas samples and set up a reflector so scientists could measure the precise distance from the Earth to the moon.\n",

      "Armstrong was also tasked with taking lots of pictures during the mission. That's why almost every NASA Apollo 11 photo you see of an astronaut on the moon actually shows Aldrin, and not Armstrong.

      "A preserved skull recently discovered in Argentina belongs to an enormous dinosaur called Sarmientosaurus musacchioi, paleontologists announced in a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Sarmientosaurus could provide a lot of new insight into a class of dinosaurs called Titanosaurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Discoveries like Sarmientosaurus happen once in a lifetime,\" paleontologist Rubén Martínez said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLOS ONE The Sarmientosaurus skull.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paleontologists rely on fossils, especially the skulls, to figure out how dinosaurs looked and how they used to behave. There are over 60 species of Titanosaurs discovered so far, but most of those fossils are incomplete, and we don't know much about them. That's why finding such a pristine skull like this one is a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Titanosaurs included the biggest land animals ever, so we want to know as much about them as we can,\" Matt Lamanna, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, said in a statement. \"But to truly understand a creature, you need to have its head. And because Titanosaur skulls are super-rare, lots of important aspects of how these dinosaurs lived and behaved have really been anybody's guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we finally have some insight. Paleontologists think the Sarmientosaurus lived around 95 million years ago and likely grew to about 40 feet long and weighed about 10 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on CT scans of the skull, it had a pretty small brain compared to its large body size. Paleontologists also think it had better vision and better hearing than many of its Titanosaur relatives. The specialized hearing may have helped it track predators or the movement of its own herd, paleontologists speculate. The bone structure suggest the Sarmientosaurus spent much of its time looking down, which probably means it ate primarily ground-based plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Sarmientosaurus skull is beautifully-preserved, which meant that we could tease out a ton of information,\" paleobiologist Lawrence Witmer said in a statement. \"It was really exciting for us to work through the CT scan data because it gave us a glimpse into the biology and lifestyle of this animal like we rarely get with dinosaurs.\"\n",

      "A recent slate of laws that target trans and gender-nonconforming people for using public bathrooms that match their gender identities have come up for debate in several U.S. states — and those in favor of the anti-trans legislation have used the defense that they are necessary measures to \"protect\" children from \"predators.\" But the anti-trans panic is a pretty weak defense, as Jessica Williams pointed out Wednesday in a Daily Show segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with Colorado state representative and chaplain Gordon James Klingenschmitt, who has been vocal about his anti-LGBT views, Williams asked him what was so scary about trans people using the bathrooms they feel safe and comfortable in. \"They not only want to be confused about their own identity,\" he said, \"but they want the rest of us to be confused with them. Now they want the government to join them in that pretense? They're making us into liars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As some members of the trans community helpfully pointed out to Williams in the same segment, Klingenschmitt's accusations of \"lying\" rely on harmful stereotypes that transgender people are somehow trying to \"trick\" everyone with their gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Klingenschmitt seems insistent that trans people are somehow dangerous, saying trans people are \"labeling\" themselves as transgender so they can get the \"access\" to \"violate others,\" and he even pulls out some Bible quotes to back up his anti-trans sentiments.\n",

      "That's when Williams flips the stereotypes around on Klingenschmitt, asking him \"Is it fair to say that because you're a priest that you're a pedophile?\" When he says \"of course not,\" she presses him on it. \"Because some people are criminals and some people are not criminals,\" Klingenschmitt says. Um, yeah ... so you're saying that the we shouldn't make broad generalizations about people? Nice one, Klingenschmitt.\n",

      "The NRA seems like an easy target for a late night host, but that didn't stop Samantha Bee from demonstrating just how absurd and hypocritical their regulations are. On Monday's Full Frontal, Bee went to great lengths to try and acquire a costume for the organization's mascot, Eddie Eagle. The NRA uses the bird to teach kids the importance of gun safety, and apparently, his costume is harder to retrieve than an actual firearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It turned out the organization that makes it easier to get a gun than Sudafed, makes it nearly impossible to acquire their giant dancing eagle,\" Bee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the host discovered at the beginning of her quest, there are several hoops to jump through to acquire an Eddie Eagle costume. For starters, there is a 20-day waiting period for costume applications, and you won't have any luck online, as the NRA bans the resale of the costume as well. Pretty strict stuff, all the more farcical when it's much easier to purchase a gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you know what I could still buy online without a big hassle?\" Bee posited. \"A used shotgun on armslist.com from a random guy down the road from the TBS headquarters in Atlanta. So I had one of my employees buy it from him in a parking lot without a background check from the trunk of his car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Incredibly, Bee's lengthy process to get a costume ended in failure, even after she tried to bribe an in-costume Eddie to get the garb for $3,000 in cash. However, she was able to purchase several guns in the process, and decided to create her own mascot, using the guns as raw materials.\n",

      "Hillary Clinton Just Took a Surprising Position on the $15 Minimum Wage\n",
      "BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Throughout her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton has consistently said that she supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. But at the CNN Democratic debate on Thursday evening, she admitted to at least one circumstance in which she'd sign a $15 minimum wage into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fairly early on in the debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked, \"If a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?\" Clinton replied, \"Of course I would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The response was surprising — Clinton has in the past made it clear that while she's generally supportive of workers agitating for a $15 minimum wage and approves of the wage on a city and statewide level, she drew the line at $12 for the federal wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders made it clear that this was news, and implied that it was either a mistake or an act of expediency in response to being cornered by a particularly probing question from Blitzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour,\" Sanders said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinton replied that she's consistently \"supported the Fight for 15\" and there was nothing inconsistent about her position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think setting the goal to get to 12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to 15, but of course if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to 15,\" Clinton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Clinton being inconsistent on a minimum wage? It's a little unclear. In the past she's said that she believed that a federal $15 minimum wage could have an adverse effect on the labor market of some cities and states — it appeared that a concern about higher unemployment was what was holding back her support for a full $15 wage. But when during the debate she said she'd green light it if a bill was sitting in front of her, it sounded more like her support for a $12 wage was a calculation about political possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arguably Clinton is being consistent if she holds the view that if gets through Congress, it reflects confidence from Congress that local economies across the country can handle the wage without an uptick in unemployment. But in an age of extraordinary congressional polarization and bills that are passed by narrow majorities, it's difficult to argue that the bill would be a faithful reflection of popular will or represent a comprehensive assessment of economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the clearest takeaway from the exchange is this: there's a consensus in the Democratic Party that the minimum wage needs to increase dramatically, and soon.\n"

      "Kelly Ripa earned her fair share of criticism in the past week — but Tuesday morning, she fought back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripa, a 15-year veteran of the Live franchise, learned quite suddenly last week that Live With Kelly and Michael co-host Michael Strahan would be leaving the show to take a permanent spot on fellow ABC program Good Morning America. After the surprise, Ripa walked off her show, and critics quickly labeled her a \"diva.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Ripa didn't use her return as a chance to call her treatment unfair or to lambast Strahan. Instead, she thanked fans for their support and used her platform to call for something relevant and vital: \"respect in the workplace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripa was reportedly given the chance to speak her mind without previous vetting of her show-opening monologue, which she delivered standing, with Strahan out of frame. She joked about the off-the-cuff nature of it, saying, \"I'm going to be completely honest. I'm fairly certain that there are trained professional snipers with tranquilizer darts in case I drift too far off message.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She called the support she received from fans \"overwhelming,\" and said she walked off because she needed time to collect her thoughts. \"After 26 years with this company, I earned the right,\" she said. \"Let's be honest. I know half of you called in sick to be here, so we get each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase \"the right\" was a well-chosen one on Ripa's part — an insistence on being treated fairly by ABC after devoting much of her life to her workplace. She hinted at that greater connection when she called Live With Kelly and Michael \"my second home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a place that I've devoted myself to not just because of you, our loyal viewers, but because of all of the producers and the crew who work on this show,\" Ripa said. She also emphasized how pleased she was that in addition to having received apologies from higher-ups, \"our parent company has assured me that Live is a priority.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it's on a nationally syndicated morning show or in a more traditional office, workplace respect is vital. Research has shown such respect can boost not just employee morale but actual productivity. That Ripa would not only put her foot down for fairer treatment from her employers, but use her platform upon her return to preach the gospel of a workplace that respects its employees, is commendable.\n",
      "\n",

      "Astronomers just discovered a bizarre star unlike anything we've ever seen before, according to research published in the journal Science.\n",
      "\n",
      "The star, which astronomers have nicknamed \"Dox,\" has an outer layer that is 99.9% oxygen, making it the most oxygen-rich atmosphere ever discovered. (Earth's atmosphere is only about 21% oxygen.)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Thanks to its legalization, marijuana is slowly shedding its stigma and creeping further into normalized lifestyles. One such way is through food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marijuana edibles remains relatively new territory for many, but people are picking up on its health benefits, including a high that's rather different from smoking. Eating marijuana processes it through the liver, so the chemicals of THC become metabolized into 11-hydroxy-THC, according to the Daily Beast. This process gives users a slower, longer high — which many medical marijuana patients have found useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make edibles, you need to fuse together marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, with a fat, such as oil or butter, in a process that starts off with something called decarboxylation, High Times reported. That's basically heating up the dry plant matter so that the THC loses its acid group and becomes active — it's similar to how you'd burn weed to smoke it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After decarboxylation, people can choose to infuse the marijuana with butter or oil. However, it's the oils with the highest fat content, like coconut or olive, that'll absorb the most THC, according to the Cannabist.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're making oil, keep it at low heat when you add the cannabis. Otherwise you risk burning off the THC, the Cannabist reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "When adding weed, don't just use whatever's sitting in your grinder: It's important to get the dosing right. Beginners should start with around 5 milligrams of THC; Colorado's serving size is 10 milligrams of THC, according to the Cannabist. Here's the math: On average, a single gram of cannabis has at least 100 milligrams of THC, so to get 5 milligrams of THC per cookie, you would want a recipe that made 20 cookies.\n",

      "For years, spiral-shaped holes, called puquios, that dot the dry landscape in Nazca, Peru, have confused archaeologists. But now, the BBC reports, a team of researchers using satellite images has mapped out the spread of the puquios, including previously unknown holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puquios are part of a \"sophisticated hydraulic system constructed to retrieve water from underground aquifers,\" Rosa Lasaponara of the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis, in Italy, who conducted the research, told the BBC. \"What is clearly evident today is that the puquio system must have been much more developed than it appears today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasaponara and her team used satellite images to analyze the placement of the puquios and realized the extent to which they moved water throughout the region. There is a system of tunnels underground, connecting the puquios. Each spiral hole pulls air down into the canals, moving the water through the network and bringing it to people who would have used it for both agriculture and domestic life, Lasaponara told the BBC. A more complete idea of how the puquios are connected also gives clues about when they were created, an issue long debated by archaeologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "To design such a system would have meant that the ancient Nazca people who built them had extensive knowledge about the geography of the area, Lasaponara told the BBC. The irrigation tunnels may also be connected to the Nazca lines, giant geoglyphs of animals, people and shapes carved into the Nazca desert, Lasaponara told the BBC.\n",

On Thursday, CNN reported that the U.K. government had added an update to its official foreign travel advice for visitors to the U.S. under the \"Local laws and customs\" section, saying \"The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country. LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi.\"\n",

      "The warning refers to both HB2 — the so-called bathroom bill that recently passed in North Carolina, which bans trans people from using public restrooms that are not their assigned gender, and Mississippi's \"religious freedom\" law — also recently passed, that legalizes discrimination against LGBT people if it is \"consistent with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction,\" reports CNN.\n",

      "It's usually not polite to talk about politics at the dinner table, but there are exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the dinner shared between Virginia Rep. Don Beyer and the Pintos, a Latino family of five who live in Virginia. The Pintos were very clear in their message to Beyer: If immigration authorities were to deport undocumented members of their family, the only family member left in America would be 8-year-old Christian, who was born in Arlington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights sponsored the dinner, which consisted of the Pintos entire family: father and construction worker, Jerry Pinto Sr.; mother Elvira Pinto, who hopes to be a flight attendant; daughter Ambar Pinto, a college student and aspiring immigration lawyer; and sons Christian and Jerry. The family moved to Fairfax after their Arlington house burned down in a fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to ThinkProgress, who attended the dinner, while there was a lot of light conversation — youngest Christian spoke about hoverboards and video games — Pinto Sr. eventually brought up how he lives in fear of being reported to immigration officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's gotta be hard for you because you're hiding all the time,\" Beyer said to Jerry, ThinkProgress reported. \"That's a long time for you to be in legal limbo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal limbo Beyer referenced is the current challenge to Obama's executive actions on immigration. If the U.S. implemented Obama's executive actions, immigrants in America would be eligible for deportation deferral, work permits and state driver's licenses. But right now, the action is held up in the case United States v. Texas, which the Supreme Court will begin to hear oral arguments for on April 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my parents were in deportation proceedings, my family would completely break apart,\" a teary-eyed Ambar Pinto told ThinkProgress. \"If it was my dad, I would be the one responsible to sustain my family because my mom doesn't have access to a driver's license and she works from time to time. I don't know what would happen to my brothers. It's important that we have DAPA so that my parents won't be deported for at least two years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the saddest moment in the dinner came when youngest son Christian commented on what would happen if Donald Trump were to be elected president.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Donald Trump wins, I'm glad I have a passport,\" Christian said, referencing the trips he'd have to make to visit his family. Around 5.3 million children in the U.S. have a parent who is an undocumented immigrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Beyer, Christian and other children of undocumented immigrants are \"indistinguishable from my children, my nieces and nephews who were born in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For Beyer, the dinner was less a persuasive tool (the Congressman already supports immigration reform) but a model for many of his anti-immigrant colleagues to use as a way to interact with immigrant families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would say that they just don't understand the problem,\" Beyer said to ThinkProgress. \"It shows no compassion at all. As with this family, the youngest is a U.S. citizen born here. Another one has deferred action status. The parents have no papers. And yet we don't want to break them into three or four different pieces, or even two pieces.\"\n",

      "Are Aliens Real? If They Are, Science Says They Won’t Look Like What You Expect\n",
      "Will humanity one day find kindred brethren among the stars? It makes for good books and movies, and recent scientific discoveries have suggested planets in the same habitable range of conditions as Earth may be surprisingly common.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if life has risen on other planets, the differences between Homo sapiens and our new, otherworldly friends are likely to be greater than Star Trek would have you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't have humanoid biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old sci-fi trope aliens will look a lot like humans, except with some casually rearranged features to make them look exotic, has no basis in science. While the phenomenon of convergent evolution has resulted in many Earth species developing similar traits (such as flight) independently, those features evolved under similar terrestrial and evolutionary conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wild-eyed tales of little green men have entertained humans for generations. But the only plausible theory for a truly humanoid alien presence in the galaxy might be panspermia, a theory in which some creator either deliberately seeded life on different planets or microbes spread around the universe on space junk. Otherwise, the odds that of all the infinite forms alien life could take, it would mirror humanity, are very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't look much like Earth life at all, actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unique properties of carbon, which forms double bonds with other carbon atoms \"naturally and easily\" compared to other elements like silicon, form the basis of all organic chemistry, Scientific American wrote. \"Carbon is the main component of sugars, proteins, fats, DNA, muscle tissue, pretty much everything in your body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But life forms with alternate biochemistries based on elements like silicon could evolve on different planetary conditions. Though water is by far the most common and suitable organic solvent available for life on other planets, it's also possible other compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen sulfide could fill the role. Change any of the building blocks common to life on Earth — or simply change any of the local conditions in which those building blocks are assembled — and the odds other living worlds will much resemble ours fades significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Massachusetts Institute of Technology planetary scientist Sara Seager, along with colleagues William Bains and Renyu Hu, built models intended to detect exoplanets where atmospheric gases are out of equilibrium, thus suggesting biological or mechanical interference in its natural chemistry, New Scientist reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \"On planets with atmospheres dominated by hydrogen, the model predicts that methyl chloride, dimethyl sulfide and nitrous oxide could indicate the presence of life: Plausible amounts of alien life at the surface could produce them in quantities that are detectable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Life on these planets might have radically different biological plans, from radial instead of bilateral symmetry to only having one cell. Anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might not want to communicate with us, or destroy us, or even have the desire or ability to do either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alien ambassadors welcoming the Earth into a galactic union, or alternately alien soldiers leveling entire cities using war machines brimming with plasma weaponry, are common fixtures in fiction. But even assuming any alien life humanity discovers out in the universe is complex and intelligent, that intelligence may be so thoroughly alien as to make meaningful interaction unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, given humanity's proven track record of violence, war and mayhem, and our remarkable adaptiveness to a range of conditions, it's possible other species might view us as a threat worth avoiding at all costs, as joked in the video above.\n",

      "\"Athleisure\" might've just been added to the dictionary, but some universities aren't ready to embrace the Lululemon strappy tank top trend just yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the case for Danielle, a student at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, who was kicked out of the school's fitness center for inappropriate attire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was she wearing a see-through top? Pasties? This underboob bra? Nope. This is what she was wearing when the incident occurred:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your shirt is cut too low in the back,\" a student employee told Danielle, as recounted in an interview with Total Sorority Move. \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Confused because this is exactly what many girls are wearing in gyms (and to the mall... and to class... and to pretty much everywhere else) across the country? Danielle was a little thrown off as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to her, the private school's fitness center dress code states \"all users must wear proper fitness attire.\" The following details are available on the university's website, as well as in an explanatory PDF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Washington & Lee\n",
      "\n",
      "The school does not allow \"sleeveless shirts with the arm holes or gaps open below the bottom of the shoulder blades\" or \"shirts that expose parts of the abdominal area, rib cage, and/or the lower back, front or sides of the torso. (For the purposes of this policy the lower back is the area below a horizontal line under the shoulder blades.)\" Because, rib cages are dangerous, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danielle was not without a sense of humor about the ridiculousness of her ejection. In her (sarcastic) words, \"the whopping four boys in the fitness center could safely enjoy their workouts without stumbling upon the erotica that was displayed in the form of a keyhole on my top.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The school is defending their archaic protocol. The school's website states the dress code was put into place for the \"health and safety of all users,\" to \"[prevent] skin infections and to preserve the longterm life of the equipment.\" Two completely different ideas here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since conversation has started on social media, the school has posted a statement on its website from the Director of Athletics stating, \"We want to assure the W&L community that the policy applies equally to men and women.\" Sure. Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got some questions here: Wasn't Danielle's tank designed specifically for the gym? Who is she even putting in danger by wearing a cut-out top? Herself? She's an adult, can't she take that risk on her own? Perhaps the fitness director just really, really hates Lululemon?\n",
      "\n",
      "They aren't the only school with a strict dress code. Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, requires students to cover their shoulders. The school said the policy was put in place for safety reasons, similar to what Washington and Lee said, as there is a risk of MRSA and other staph infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "These aren't two isolated instances. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee also has a rule in place that states shirts must \"fully [cover] the back, shoulders, chest, stomach and sides.\" While the school stated health concerns as one reason for the rule, it also cited this: \"Muscle-bound men in cut-off shirts might deter freshmen from working out.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Want to ban tank tops for health reasons? Fine. But if these schools are using safety as an excuse to ban clothing to avoid \"distraction,\" and/or discriminating against one sex, than this is a case of schools unnecessarily policing their students' wardrobes.\n",

      "\n",
      "At a youth town hall Sunday in London, MSNBC reports that Obama expressed sympathy for the grievances of the criminal justice reform movement, but was skeptical of their tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't just keep on yelling at them and you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" Obama said, per MSNBC. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable — that can institutionalize the changes you seek and to engage the other side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: Why Bill Clinton Just Tripped Up Hillary in the Worst Way Possible\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama said he felt the Black Lives Matter movement was falling prey to a problem that afflicts all too many activists — an inability to translate advocacy into concrete programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too often what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately ... that they never take that next step and say, 'Well now I have to sit down and try to actually get something done?'\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem: Obama's sentiment that activists can be better at agitating than execution is fair as a general concern, but in the case of Black Lives Matter it misses the mark by quite a wide margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, Black Lives Matter did very rapidly form a wing that engaged institutional politics. In the last year, activists from the movement have met with officials at the White House and Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Movement members have launched multiple Black Lives Matter political action committees to support political candidates who take up their banner (although they've had a slow start). And some activists met with liberal megadonors at the Democracy Alliance's annual gathering in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "Activist meetings with political movers and shakers have entailed the discussion of a wide range of issues, but there's evidence that they've had a real focus. Campaign Zero, which has figured prominently in high-level discussions, has laid out a very specific vision of police reforms required to reverse trends of police violence and overzealous arrest rates in communities of color. And when Democrats have discussed things like a \"new New Deal\" that invests funds in low-resource minority neighborhoods, it's precisely because activists have pushed them to use that language.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is Obama talking about? He may just be venting about the pressure that the Clintons — who occupy the same space in establishment Democratic politics that he does — have been experiencing in recent months from activists at speaking events. Hillary Clinton was called out in February for her 1996 reference to certain young black criminals as \"super predators,\" and Bill Clinton was disrupted during a speech earlier in April over the 1994 crime bill. Perhaps in Obama's eyes, those kinds of actions have been overly shrill and a distraction from the kind of mature and sober meetings that activists should be having behind closed doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that complaint is weak as well. Those confrontations have spurred serious public conversations about the past that matter in the present. Talking about the dehumanizing language that politicians on both sides of the aisle used toward black youth in the '90s has been important for contextualizing the kinds of anti-crime policies that were pursued at the time.

Both those impulses complement each other by shifting the conversation, and then translating that conversation into action.

      "Shocking Report: Chicago Police Department Is Really, Really Racist\n",
      "In November, widely maligned Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the formation of a Police Accountability Task Force, a five-member panel designed to \"review the system of accountability, oversight and training that is currently in place for Chicago's police officers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, that panel released an 18-page draft of its executive summary to the Chicago Tribune. Here's one takeaway: The Chicago Police Department is really, really racist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report states, according to the Tribune:\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism and maltreatment at the hands of the police have been consistent complaints from communities of color for decades. False arrests, coerced confessions and wrongful convictions are also a part of this history. Lives lost and countless more damaged. These events and others mark a long, sad history of death, false imprisonment, physical and verbal abuse and general discontent about police actions in neighborhoods of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's this:\n",
      "\n",
      "The community's lack of trust in CPD is justified. There is substantial evidence that people of color — particularly African-Americans — have had disproportionately negative experiences with the police over an extended period of time. There is also substantial evidence that these experiences continue today through significant disparate impacts associated with the use of force, foot and traffic stops and bias in the police oversight system itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summary goes on to make a series of recommendations, including abolishing the Independent Police Review Authority — which internally investigates misconduct allegations — and the department \"superintendent publicly acknowledging CPD's history of racial disparity and discrimination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, that the Chicago Police Department is racist amounts to maybe the worst-kept secret in America: In the past six months, the Windy City has been all but upended by the release of video footage showing police officer Jason Van Dyke killing black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, which prompted weeks of protests, the firing of former CPD superintendent Garry McCarthy and the eventual ouster at the polls of Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state's attorney who waited 400 days to charge Van Dyke with a crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the department's problems go far beyond that. For the past half century, Chicago has been reeling from the aftershock left by Jon Burge, a former CPD commander who, between 1972 and 1991, orchestrated the torture and often-false imprisonment of more than 100 people, who were \"virtually all\" black. Burge's victims were awarded portions of a $5.5 million reparations fund set up for them by the city in April 2015 — a sum that adds to the $500 million Chicago has spent on legal costs stemming from police misconduct in the last 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's just the splashy stuff. The full report is expected as early as this week, but meanwhile, the Chicago Police Department is racist, water is wet, fire is hot and ice is cold.\n",
      "\n",

      "For Trump, why Goldwater history will repeat itself in the fall\n",
      "Let's then take the argument that because Trump is winning GOP primaries in blue states by large margins that he puts those states \"in play\" in November. Trump got 60 percent of the vote in New York. That sounds great. But he received around 500,000 votes. Clinton got more than 1 million. Trump cannot win New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also can't win California even if he prevails in the state's primary by a wide margin on June 7. Currently, Clinton leads Trump by 30 points, 59 to 29, in California. There is simply no way the state becomes competitive. Clinton will easily hold onto the core elements of the Democratic Electoral College base.\n",
      "\n",
      "A better question is whether Clinton's huge advantages among women (53 percent of the 2012 vote) and minorities (28 percent) put traditional red states in play. Clinton leads Trump in Arizona and received about the same number of votes as Trump in the state's primary. Clinton also received more votes than Trump in the Georgia primary and polled very close to him in Alabama and Mississippi. She got more votes than Trump in Louisiana and Arkansas. Bernie Sanders received more votes than Trump in Oklahoma. Clinton got over 100,000 more votes than Trump in Virginia. You get the picture. Overall, Trump has received about 10 million primary votes to 12 million for Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's stipulate that anything is possible in 2016. A new, better, more presidential Trump who does not completely alienate women, African-Americans and Latinos could emerge between now and November. But we've seen how previous attempts to be \"presidential\" have gone for Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving away from his core brand of uncensored attacks could also crush Trump's turnout among white men, who he needs to win in record numbers. Clinton could somehow stumble in debates (very unlikely) or investigations into her email use could take a surprising turn (also unlikely).\n",
      "\n",
      "At bottom, there is very little reason to think the current picture — a very big Clinton win — will change very much between now and November. The GOP with Trump on the top of the ticket will probably go down to a Goldwater-type defeat and once again the Republican Party will have to try and reinvent itself at the presidential level.\n",
      "2016 Wisconsin Democratic Primary: Bernie Sanders Defeats Hillary Clinton by a Mile\n",
      "Bernie Sanders defeated Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, underscoring his staying power as a tribune of the progressive left.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Associated Press called the race for Sanders at 9:44 p.m. Early exit polls showed him with a double-digit lead over Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the result doesn't upend the fundamental dynamics of the Democratic contest, in which Clinton has built a large delegate lead, it points to the desire of many Democratic voters for the spirited primary contest to continue, even as much of the party establishment clamors for unity behind Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vermont senator's victory comes a little more than a week after he handily defeated Clinton in contests in Hawaii, Alaska and Washington. His win also comes on the heels of the news that in March, Sanders — powered by small donors — out-fundraised Clinton for the third month in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road ahead: On Saturday, Sanders is likely to notch yet another win in the Wyoming caucuses, but his great hope is that his winning streak delivers crucial momentum heading into the New York primary on April 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polls show Clinton's lead over Sanders shrinking in her adoptive home state, and while she'd retain a healthy delegate lead even if she lost the Empire State narrowly, a loss would mark a humiliating blow for her campaign, and may raise doubts among Democratic elites about the strength of her candidacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, the Democratic contest is virtually certain to continue through the final nominating contests in early June. Sanders has pledged to remain in the race until voters in each state and territory have had their say, and Tuesday's result bolsters his case for doing just that.\n",

      "\n",
      "The plunge in provision will not be due to the usual suspect — budget cuts — but rather the return of work requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 1990s, the federal government has required food stamp recipients to fulfill a work requirement in order to receive them for more than three months. But during the recession and its aftermath, those requirements were suspended out of concern that it was unfair to demand work in a period of high unemployment. Now that growth and jobs numbers are stronger, the requirements are locking back into place at a rapid pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read more: 7 Harmful Myths We Need to Stop Telling About Poverty\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Washington Post reports, work requirements will be reinstated in 22 states in 2016, and is estimated to cause between half a million and a million people who fit certain criteria — able-bodied, without children — to lose their benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the map made by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities below, you can see the states reinstating work requirements for the first time since the recession. Other states have already put them back in place. By the end of the year, 40 states will have strict time limits on how long people can receive food stamps without fulfilling work requirements, according to the CBPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all states reintroducing work requirements have had their economies bounce back enough that they're being forced by the federal government to return to work requirements. Instead, they're choosing to give up their exemption anyway. Why? Mainly because of local political cultures that tend to look upon the social safety net with a skeptical eye, and believe that work requirements will discourage laziness. As the Post notes, in 2016, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia's economies are weak enough to remain exempt from work requirements, but the states are reinstating them anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it fair? The labor markets in a lot of the states that have recovered more slowly are probably less healthy than they appear. There are plenty of towns in the U.S. where structural problems in the local economy have devastated people's job prospects so much that they've dropped out of the job search altogether, and don't even show up in unemployment numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even in towns and states where it's not extremely difficult to find a job, there's little evidence that making someone hungrier makes them any better at finding a job. And the option for people to use job training programs to opt out of work requirements isn't particularly effective because few states offer enough of them to their residents.\n",

      "Following the discovery of Mittendorff's body, investigators found that she had been the victim of vicious, sexist cyberbullying by her coworkers on a local forum called the Fairfaxunderground. \"A new tramp emerges for us to watch destroy herself. Nicole Mittendorff at 32 is already slutting her way around the county, \" one user wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, fire Chief Richard Bowers released a statement saying that the authorities are aware of the posts, and the department \"will thoroughly investigate this matter and take any appropriate actions needed.\" Mic reached out on Monday to see if there are any specific plans to address sexism in the firehouse, and was told the administration has \"no further comment\" beyond Bowers published statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Virginia fire department has a history of slut shaming female coworkers, often naming and discussing specific coworkers on this forum. Back in 2014, a female forum user who went by the username funtimegal shared her experience of being sexually harassed in the predominantly male culture of the local fire department.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a firefighter for 15 years,\" funtimegal wrote. \"I know guys talk behind my back and have seen pictures of me in their lockers. I have been passed up for promotions because of what the board 'have heard'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind of bullying Mittendorff faced isn't unique to the Fairfax County Fire Department. Former California firefighter Alicia Dabney told the New York Times that her workplace had a \"frat boy atmosphere\" and described finding fliers with the words \"Alicia Dabney is a whore\" on the floor of the fire station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retired deputy fire chief John Murphy in Washington has been outspoken about the need to address misogynistic firehouse culture across the country. \"There's a feeling that women don't belong in the fire service,\" Murphy said in a phone interview. \"There are a lot of women who are sexually harassed, bullied and raped on duty who don't report it because they want to continue their jobs... there needs to be an anonymous reporting mechanism, for people who are harassed, that will actually lead to action to stop that behavior.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From assault to bullying, Murphy believes many firefighters are afraid to report workplace sexism because they don't think they'll get help. \"Often when it is reported, the administration doesn't do anything about it,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy believes the firehouse culture is still a \"good old white boys club,\" where women, people of color and LGBTQ firefighters often face hostile work environments. \"I'm familiar with two or three gay firefighters and it took them a while to find a place where they weren't harassed,\" Murphy said. \"There's an attitude of 'you need to find somewhere else to work.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unclear whether harassment was a contributing factor in Mittendorff's decision to take her own life. Either way, however, Bowers denied to WHSV that the fire department offered a hostile, potentially sexually abusive environment for female coworkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I assure you that my department cannot and will not tolerate bullying of any kind,\" he said.\n",

      "When it comes to North Carolina's House Bill 2, the state's NAACP branch wants the legislature to know: We're not going to stand for it. Literally.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 23, North Carolina passed HB 2, a law requiring citizens to use the bathroom that matches the gender they were assigned at birth rather than the gender they identity as — and it hasn't taken long for critics of the bill to speak out. There has already been a statewide PayPal pullout and a canceled Bruce Springsteen concert among other protests against the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the North Carolina NAACP is threatening to stage a series of sit-ins if the legislature does not repeal HB 2 by April 21. At a press conference on Saturday, Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said that he would call the bill, \"Hate Bill 2.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are organizing and planning now a campaign of mass sit-ins at the general assembly, calling on people of faith, people of conscience to join as a moral witness against this unconstitutional and immoral legislation,\" Barber said. \"We cannot allow this kind of codifying hate in our constitution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber explained what he believed to be the true motivations behind the bill. \"Hate Bill 2 ... is a race-based, class-based, homophobic discriminatory bill ... that is nothing more than the politics of Jesse Helms revisited,\" Barber said. Helms was a famous 1960s-era conservative from North Carolina who stridently opposed civil rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Barber, HB 2 was never about bathrooms. \"It's not about bathrooms, just like segregated bathrooms was never about bathrooms,\" he said. \"It was about a political statement; it was about oppression; it was about having public signs of domination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber was adamant that the religious reasons for the bill were misguided and hypocritical, stating that true religion would be on the side of the marginalized and oppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True religion starts with how you care for the poor, the least of these, the broken and the marginalized and the pushed out and the stranger,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Carolina legislature is not due to return until April 25, which means that they would have to convene a special session in order to repeal the law before then. Thus far, lawmakers have claimed they are unwilling to do so. While convening an \"emergency session\" sounds like a Herculean task, there is precedent: HB 2 itself was actually passed by North Carolina lawmakers during an \"emergency session,\" and Gov. Pat McCrory signed the bill later that same night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite zero recorded instances of a trans person ever assaulting someone in a bathroom, HB 2 is currently law in North Carolina. Thankfully, the NAACP will stand up and sit down for the rights of North Carolina's transgender citizens.\n",
      "The Fed 'is a god that has failed'—George Gilder—commentary\n",
      "The reason, as I document in my book, \"The Scandal of Money: Why Wall Street Recovers but the Economy Never Does\" is that Washington and the Federal Reserve together have created a closed loop economy where the Fed creates money for the government and the S&P 500 and Main Street is left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed decides what money is worth and who receives it and how much. The Fed prices it at zero interest rates, allegedly to stimulate economic growth. But whenever something is free, it's distributed by queue, and only the privileged, connected people in the front of the line get any, not the innovators who create growth and opportunity for Main Street. Trump voters are wrong if they blame Mexico and China, but they are right about one big thing: The economy is rigged against them.\n",
      "Michael Jordan, King of North Carolina, Has Come Out Against Gov. Pat McCrory's HB2 Bill\n",
      "Michael Jordan, king of the court and keeper of the keys to North Carolina's heart, is speaking out against the state's anti-trans legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signed into law on March 23 by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, House Bill 2 bans transgender individuals from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity and forbids local municipalities from prohibiting sexual orientation- and gender based-discrimination in their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being challenged repeatedly on the legislation, McCrory has stayed the course, maintaining that the law is a \"common sense\" proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement to the Charlotte Observer, the famously apolitical basketball legend shared that he and his franchises do not support the new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment,\" Jordan said in a statement to the Observer in response to an interview request regarding HB2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raw Story reported that although some have dismissed his statement as \"weak,\" Jordan is known for steering clear of political controversy. He stayed silently when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar publicly accused him of ignoring human rights violations by Nike in favor of making profits, and refused to endorse Harvey Gantt, an African American Democrat, who ran for North Carolina Senate against noted segregationist Jesse Helms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events at Time Warner Cable Arena,\" Jordan's statement said.\n",

      "\n",
      "She had sought out the advice of an older male friend about waging a campaign to unseat an incumbent in her California district. \"He put his hand on my knee and said, 'Sweetie, just wait 20 years [and] maybe you can run,'\" she recalled in an interview Monday.\n",

      "Why she's running: Schrode summed up her rationale for running in a March 29 Medium post:\n",
      "\n",
      "Broken policy is failing us all, as fear and vitriol permeate politics. I can no longer watch as partisan gridlock threatens our future and that of communities around the country. We need common sense reform? —? and we need it en masse, yesterday. Clean water is a human right. Women add value to society. Mental health is a veritable illness. Black lives matter. Affordable healthcare helps families. Education can be an economic engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's time to deliver on the promise of my generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schrode's website described her as a \"citizen activist, community organizer and vocal advocate for environmental action, social justice, public health and responsible consumption.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her activist roots go back to 2005, when reports of high cancer rates in her home county spurred her to co-found Turning Green, \"a national nonprofit organization devoted to education and advocacy around environmentally sustainable and socially responsible choices for individuals, schools and communities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York University graduate knows she doesn't fit the mold of the stereotypical American politician (\"I think man, I think middle-aged, I think law degree,\" she said) and that's part of what she said is right about her campaign to unseat Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You should have a breadth of backgrounds in Congress — and right now we just don't,\" she said in a phone conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Schrode insisted that she doesn't want to be judged on her age or gender, but by her ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty-something: At the moment, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress is New York Republican Elise Stefanik. The Harvard graduate was 30 when she won her upstate 21st District seat, and now chairs the Millennial Task Force of the House Policy Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schrode sees Stefanik not merely as the nation's youngest congresswoman (to date), but \"an intelligent, capable elected official who is young and who is a woman,\" although they have divergent political views.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stefanik's sex and her age alone, Schrode said, \"should not define her. That should not define me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Erin Schrode\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital footprint: Another thing Schrode said sets her apart from older officials and candidates: Like her millennial peers, she grew up a digital native. \"I had Facebook throughout high school,\" she said. \"I Instagram the food that I eat. I am vocal about my points of view on Twitter. There's a 10-year digital footprint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She's proud of the life she's lived (and documented), she said, \"It's been a journey of someone who was never preparing to be a politician.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Change from within: After a life of world travels, speeches and advocacy, Schrode said she ultimately realized that although she hadn't planned on politics, it would be the best way for her to bring the changes she wants to see in environmental protection, public health, women's rights and social justice — in Northern California and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The people I want to vote for won't run for office. The most talented, capable individuals of integrity that I know don't want to be associated with politics. That's a problem,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When people are shirking the political arena, [you] have to have people who still go into the system,\" Schrode said. \"Maybe I'm an idealist, but I haven't lost hope.\"\n"

      "The Bigfoot Mystery May Actually Be Explained by This Extinct Creature\n",
      "Think Bigfoot is just a legend? Think again... maybe. Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, is a mythical human-like, hairy creature whose unproven existence has inspired reports of sightings for years. But there's actually a long-extinct giant ape called Gigantopithecus that roamed the Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago — and its existence has lead some to wonder, is this the \"real\" Bigfoot?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), which calls itself \"the only scientific research organization exploring the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery,\" Bigfoot is \"a large, hairy, bipedal non-human primate.\" Hmm, that sounds a lot like the Gigantopithecus, which was an enormous ape that stood more than 10 feet tall and weighed 1,200 pounds, according to Smithsonian.\n",
      "\n",
      "While today's Bigfoot sightings are probably just wishful thinking, Gigantopithecus was very, very real. First discovered in 1935, the ape genus appears to have lived in South Asia and ate a diet of fruits, seeds and grasses like bamboo, Smithsonian reported. Like its modern cousin, the orangutan, Gigantopithecus probably walked on all fours using its feet and fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not clear exactly why Gigantopithecus went extinct: It may have been hunted to death by other primates or had lethally low reproductive rates, according to Smithsonian. But some believers claim that Gigantopithecus and Bigfoot are one and the same, and that the giant ape never went extinct after all, theorizing that it's just hiding in forests and popping out periodically to surprise hikers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But scientists seem certain that Gigantopithecus is long-gone, so its huge fossilized teeth may be the closest we'll ever get to the \"real Bigfoot.\"\n",

      "A man in Harris County, Texas, was beaten to death in a jail cell on April 5 less than 48 hours after failing to post bail, authorities told the Houston Press. Patrick Joseph Brown, 46, was booked on a misdemeanor theft charge on April 3 for allegedly stealing a guitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, Brown was denied a personal bond at his hearing and asked to pay $3,000 to walk free — an amount he could not afford. He was then sent to the Harris County Jail to await trial. Less than 48 hours later, he was found unresponsive in the holding cell he'd shared with several other men, including Curtis Maxwell and Ebenezer Nah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maxwell and Nah had beaten Brown to within an inch of his life. He was pronounced dead at nearby Memorial Hermann Hospital soon after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Google Maps\n",
      "\n",
      "All three men were reportedly booked on either April 2 or 3, meaning they'd been in the jail together three days at most. Maxwell and Nah have both been charged with aggravated assault causing seriously bodily injury, Harris County Sheriff's spokesman Ryan Sullivan told the Press last Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still unclear what caused the dispute that led to Brown's murder, but according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, homicide is a rare cause of death in local jails — lagging far behind illness and suicide, the two leading causes. Nevertheless, the 46-year-old's exposure to factors that led to his demise remain a stark reminder of the consequences America's criminal justice system holds for those who can't shoulder its financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "In places like Harris County, Ferguson, Missouri, Montgomery, Alabama, and elsewhere, poor people easily get ensnared in a cycle of debt and incarceration, as their inability to pay fees stemming from minor offenses incur increasingly more financial, and legal, penalties. The result is a system where being poor becomes a de facto crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Press, guards are supposed to check on inmates at the Harris County Jail every 15 minutes, and it was during one of these checks that Brown's prone body was discovered. One of Brown's former girlfriends told the Houston Chronicle that he left behind a teenage son, who is devastated by the loss of his father.\n",

      "Humans have always wondered about life beyond the stars. The curiosity doesn't only stem from popular culture and the advent of film and television, but even before then. Books, oral stories and painting depicted \"evidence\" of aliens. People have always thought about extraterrestrial life, what aliens would look like, and if the creatures would come in peace, if they exist. But what are the nation's scientists and researchers saying about the potential existence of aliens?\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA's administrator believes we are not alone. In 2015, Charles Bolden, who has been the administrator of NASA since 2009, said, \"I do believe that we will someday find other forms of life or a form of life, if not in our solar system then in some of the other solar systems — the billions of solar systems in the universe,\" according to the Telegraph.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Today we know that there are literally thousands, if not millions of other planets, many of which may be very similar to our own earth,\" the 69-year-old former astronaut continued. \"So some of us, many of us believe that we're going to find ... evidence that there is life elsewhere in the universe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the History Channel, Frank Drake, a notable astronomer, created an equation that was able to \"estimate the likelihood of the existence of alien life, taking into account a number of factors including the average number of planets able to support life and the fraction that could go on to support intelligent life.\" The equation found that \"hundreds of thousands\" of planets that could support extraterrestrial beings could (and should) exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why haven't they contacted us? There are several hypotheses that try to explain why aliens haven't reached out to Earthlings. One theory, titled the \"Zoo hypothesis,\" posits that aliens are actually preventing us from contacting them, so that the extraterrestrial beings don't interrupt our natural development. In short, Earth might be a \"zoo\" for aliens, to watch our growth as a species.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fermi Paradox is multi-layered, but a branch of the theory known as the Rare Earth Hypothesis essentially posits that humanity is the only species to have made it through the \"Great Filter,\" a set of circumstances that make life possible, such as living on a planet that is just close enough to the Sun, or having just the right set of evolutionary events occur to create life.

      "\n",
      "Even though it's 2016, women are still routinely humiliated and treated dismissively by health care providers, from doctors to pharmacists. On Thursday, a 19-year-old student who goes by momdadimrae on Reddit went to the gynecologist, where she was subjected to a slew of snide remarks after she told him she struggled with depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went to the gynecologist for the first time for an IUD consultation. In the span of 20 minutes, he belittled me for being on antidepressants since 14, told me that depression doesn't exist and I should stop whining, and yelled a nurse out of the room,\" momdadimrae wrote on Reddit. \"He kept berating me, asking me if it was school or home that made me sad and seek attention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her horror story about this sexist doctor quickly went viral, garnering hundreds of comments. Outraged users encouraged momdadimrae to report the doctor for misconduct, to which she enthusiastically replied \"I am definitely going to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, momdadimrae is not alone. Reddit is full of women sharing horror stories about their shoddy treatment at the hands of medical professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although she asked to remain anonymous, momdadimrae said this was not her first experience being shamed by a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I started taking oral contraceptives when I was 16, and I had to see 3 different doctors before one would give me a prescription,\" she said in an email interview, \"because the general attitude amongst the doctors I had seen was, 'You are too immature to handle birth control.' ... Their reasoning was that I was only 16 so I shouldn't be worrying about sex and things like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until she saw a female doctor that momdadimrae finally got a prescription. (It's worth noting that in Canada, there is no minimum age for prescribing birth control; the decision is largely left up to the physicians themselves.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another user, mintcakefrog, replied to momdadimrae's story with her own humiliating experience getting an IUD. After she told the gynecologist she had stayed in a mental hospital, the doctor reportedly called in mintcakefrog's partner and \"proceeded to talk to him and asked if I was able to consent and explained the procedure to me like I was 5 years old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it's not just female patients with a history of mental health issues who are shamed by physicians. Other female patients have reported being slut-shamed by their gynecologists, including 21-year-old Reddit user ssaen, whose story went viral last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"[My OB-GYN] starts by telling me that healthy sex is between two virgins in the 'lifetime-commitment of marriage.' Obviously, she knows that I am not a virgin, and tells me that I can still make the decision to abstain from sex until I am married,\" ssaen wrote. Hundreds of women replied to this post with their own horror stories. \"I specifically asked for annual pelvics when he didn't bring it up ... He then insisted I wouldn't need them, since I wasn't married,\" commenter AptCasaNova described her experience with a male doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If nothing else, the response to momdadirae's story taught her that \"there definitely needs to be a change in how women are treated by health care professionals,\" she said in the email interview. \"I have had many doctors tell me that I should steer clear of an IUD because I might want a baby in a few months. I'm 19 years old! I have the right to make informed decisions about my body and my reproductive organs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the experiences of women on Reddit make clear, it's not momdadimrae's age that makes doctors feel they have the right to question her reproductive health choices. It's also her gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When a woman says a man has done something unacceptable to her, the first question needs to be, 'How can I help you deal with this?', rather than 'Are you sure that's really what happened?'\" she said. \"Women need to be taken seriously.\"\n"

      "Fox News host Megyn Kelly talked to North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Thursday about the anti-trans bathroom bill HB2.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was the fear that led to the enactment of this law?\" Kelly asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly asked McCrory why he was \"concerned about girls exposing themselves or seeing somebody exposed\" in women's restrooms, especially since most are equipped with individual stalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "When McCrory had to defend HB2, which requires people in North Carolina to use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth rather than their gender identity, he veered off topic and said this was a problem caused by the left and not the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly next debunked claims that HB2 promotes children's safety. After she called misconceptions about transgender people as predators \"not true,\" she again asked McCrory, \"What is your fear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Typically male molesters are heterosexual, and if they want to sneak into a bathroom they'll do it,\" Kelly said. \"But 90% of the cases, molestation happens with someone you know. So what is the fear with the transgender situation in the bathrooms?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness to Light, a sexual abuse advocacy group, corroborates Kelly's statistic — 90% of child sexual abuse happens with someone the family knows or trusts.\n",
      "\n",
      "McCrory finally answered Kelly's \"fear\" question and said families have a \"basic expectation of privacy\" when it comes to their children using a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if privacy or security is McCrory's concern, HB2 doesn't seem to be the way to achieve it. There are zero recorded instances of a transgender person doing anything in a bathroom except minding their own business. In fact, many transgender and gender-nonconforming people report feeling unsafe in public bathrooms.\n",

      "'The Daily Show' Nailed How Islamophobia Hurts the Sikh Community Too\n",
      "Islamophobic rhetoric has been an undeniable part of the current Presidential election: In December, current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country, and in March, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called for armed patrols of \"Muslim neighborhoods.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fear-mongering language is arguably having an effect on the safety of Muslim communities — in December the New York Times reported on a recent spike in hate crimes against Muslim Americans — but the anti-Muslim sentiment is having an effect on non-Muslim Americans too, something The Daily Show tackled in a segment on Monday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj, who is Muslim, sat down with Sikh American and artist Waris Ahluwalia, to talk about the discrimination he faces just because he \"looks Muslim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Almost every time I fly back to the U.S. I get a secondary screening,\" Ahluwalia said. \"People assume that Sikhs are Muslims and that's primarily an issue because Sikhs are an independent religion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Harvard University's Pluralism Project, \"today there are well over 500,000 Sikhs in the United States,\" but, since 9/11, Sikh Americans have become the \"targets of varying degrees of hate crimes\" because of their turbans and beards.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to hearing from Ahluwalia, Minhaj also sat down with a panel of Sikhs living in America to hear about their experiences with discrimination. \"I've been called ISIS a lot recently,\" one of the guests told Minhaj. \"The turban is what makes us the target,\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Minhaj suggests that Sikhs could avoid some of that pesky Islamophobic discrimination simply by telling everyone they're not Muslim, the answer from the group is definitive. \"It's just not an option for us to throw another community under the bus,\" one of Minhaj's guests said. \"Even if it means things are harder for us, we believe it's the right thing to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not the way I was raised,\" Ahluwalia tells Minhaj. \"That's why I wear this turban. As a reminder to myself to treat humanity with care and kindness. So that's — so I'm not here to point fingers.\"\n",
      "What Is \"Reverse Racism\"? Here's Why It Doesn't Actually Exist in the United States\n",
      "The questions have come up before: Why isn't there a White History Month? Why isn't there a network for White Entertainment Television, like BET? Black Girls Rock? What about White Girls Rock? What about the critically acclaimed Broadway play Hamilton's call for nonwhite actors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, these few examples demonstrate \"reverse racism,\" or the discrimination against members of a dominant racial group. Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things like BET, Black Girls Rock or Black History Month are not reverse racist against white people,\" Zeba Blay, a Huffington Post Black Voices writer, illustrates in a video. \"Because remember, in a society where white is seen as the default race, all history is white history. But racism isn't just someone feeling superior to another race and then discriminating against them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Racism and prejudice aren't quite the same thing. Racism, rather, is best known as a system in which a racial majority is able to enforce its power and privilege over another race through political, economic and institutional means. Therefore racism can be described as \"prejudice plus power,\" as the two work together to create the system of inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be guilty of racism, however, to be a racist, say the revision proponents, one must have power, and power of a special sort,\" Carlos Hoyt Jr, who is an assistant professor of social work at Wheelock College, wrote in The Pedagogy of the Meaning of Racism of those who would like to change the dictionary definition of racism. \"For the revisionists, racism is prejudice plus power leveraged at an institutional level to maintain the privileges of the dominant social group.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, when the term \"reverse racism\" is brought up, it is in response to a slight that a member of the dominant group perceives has happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in reality, the United States has a long legacy of racism that makes it difficult for people of color to receive quality health care, access affordable housing, find stable employment and avoid getting wrapped up in the justice system. These examples of institutionalized racism don't quite match with the examples of reverse racism, such as \"Why don't WE have a White History Month?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There has never, ever, ever been a national set of laws or system put in place to systematically oppress white people or push them to a status that is 'less than,'\" senior editor Alexia LaFata wrote for Elite Daily. \"Not once. Ever. So 'reverse racism' can truly never exist.\"\n"

Erdogan started off as congenial and ostensibly egalitarian — for example, he attempted to smooth relations with the Kurds, who posed a threat to modern-day Turkey's sovereignty in their fight for an independent nation. He also did wonders for the economy, which was contracting when he came to power.\n",

      "After talking on the phone and eventually meeting up IRL, sparks flew. It was like they had \"known each other for years,\" West said, according to the New Day. She revealed that she soon started having recurring sex dreams about her son, who was married at the time.\n",

      "iPhone warning signs: Apple management is losing control of the situation\n",
      "Much more concerning for Apple is that the longer the remaining 60% of the installed base delays an iPhone upgrade, the longer the upgrade cycle is extending. It is not unreasonable for the iPhone installed base to extend out to four or even five years. Not surprisingly, these trends were never accurately captured in consumer survey research reports. This is unchartered territory for Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "iPhone Growth Catalysts Are Disappearing. While there are legitimate reasons for explaining some of the iPhone's recent sales declines, much more concerning is how the largest multi-year growth catalysts for the iPhone business are either disappearing or turning out to be much less attractive than first thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mobile carrier expansion is slowing. A significant contributor to iPhone sales growth over the years has been mobile carrier expansion. As Apple brought the iPhone to new mobile carriers, the device's addressable market continued to expand. In early 2014, China Mobile began selling the iPhone for the first time, opening up the iPhone to hundreds of millions of new consumers of which tens of millions were in a position to buy an iPhone right out of the gate. There are no additional carriers like China Mobile waiting in the wings where Apple can expand the iPhone's addressable market. Most of the world's population is now on a mobile carrier that sells iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. India is not the next China. India has recently been positioned as the next big growth engine for iPhone. However, it is becoming clear that this optimism has been grossly misplaced. Cook even admitted on Apple's 2Q16 earnings call that India's smartphone market is where China was seven to ten years ago. That comment is not too reassuring for anyone thinking India would pick up the sales slack from a slowing China market. The country is just not in a position to represent a significant driver for iPhone unit sales given Apple's current pricing strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. High smartphone saturation rates. High smartphone saturation rates in the U.S. and other developed countries have removed feature phone users as an iPhone growth catalyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Declining number of premium Android switchers. Apple has been very successful over the past year and a half appealing to high-end Android switchers craving larger iPhones. However, there are signs that the easy growth in terms of Android switchers is ending. There are only so many premium Android users in the marketplace, and Apple will need to begin appealing to Android users in lower price brackets to achieve the same kind of user growth. During 2015, there were approximately 1.2 billion people that bought a non-iPhone smartphone, up from a little more than 1 billion in 2014. Of that total, approximately 100 million were likely in a position to even buy a flagship iPhone. This does not exactly leave much room for Apple to grow the number of Android switchers year after year.\n"

      "The NBA Took the All-Star Game Away From Charlotte. Here's Why It Matters\n",
      "The NBA announced Thursday that negotiations had failed. In a statement the league said it had been trying to work for months with officials in North Carolina to \"foster constructive dialogue and try to effect positive change\" concerning the controversial law known as HB2, which has been widely criticized as discriminatory against LGBT people. Those efforts had met with resistance and so the NBA played a card it had threatened to throw down months before, taking the 2017 All-Star Game—with all its fanfare and economic impact—to another state. Republican Governor Pat McCrory responded by calling the move \"[politically correct] B.S.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is far from the first bad thing that has happened to North Carolina since the law was put in place earlier this year. PayPal canceled plans to bring hundreds of jobs to the state. Hollywood bigwigs promised not to film any more productions there. The likes of Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil canceled shows. The lost revenue is easily in the tens of millions. One estimate put the economic impact of the All-Star Game alone at $100 million. And while weathering all that criticism and loss makes McCrory and his allies tenacious, tar-heeled heroes to some social conservatives, critics say the state's image is being scarred deeper by the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It further sullies North Carolina's reputation,\" state senator Dan Blue, leader of the minority Democratic party, says of the NBA's decision. \"If North Carolina, through HB2, is going to be the place of inequality and unfairness and hostility, they’re not going to participate in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That the NBA made this move says something not only about the state of American culture and business, but about the league itself. More than the NFL or Major League Baseball, says Skidmore College American Studies Professor Daniel Nathan, the NBA is inclined to take progressive political stances. He believes a large part of that is due to the racial makeup of the league, in which more than 75% of players are black. (By comparison, more than 60% of MLB players are white .) The players themselves have set their own precedents for making statements, wearing hoodies in solidarity with Trayvon Martin and \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirts in solidarity with Eric Garner .\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking such a high-profile stand over LGBT issues is new—particularly when the bathroom use of transgender people is at the center of the controversy—and black Americans tend to be less supportive than some other racial demographics when it comes to key LGBT issues like same-sex marriage. But academics who study sport culture in America believe that the broad parallels, the shared issues of minority status and discrimination, overcome the specifics. In the Jim Crow era of the 1950s, NBA teams from other states threatened not to come back to North Carolina because of how black players had been treated in Charlotte, separated from white players for meals and made to stay in separate hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It’s the league responding to the issue of difference,\" says Reuben Buford May, a sociology professor at Texas A&M. \"Minority athletes can appreciate that even if they may not agree with LGBT communities.\" While white people may never really understand what it's like to be black, and while there is surely still homophobia in the NBA, variety in sexual orientation and gender identity cuts across all racial groups, he adds: \"If you are white, black, Hispanic, Asian, anything, you could have in your family someone who is LGBT.\" In its statement on the move , the NBA said the league had been \"guided in these discussions by the long-standing core values of our league,\" adding that those include \"diversity, inclusion, fairness and respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The move of course comes with the risk of alienating more conservative fans or people who think that the NBA simply shouldn't be weighing into state-level political squabbles, but the league is falling in line with a sweeping trend in American business. And this move is proof that its only going to continue. As LGBT people have become more accepted, big businesses have become the LGBT movement's greatest ally. From Apple to Salesforce to NASCAR, business leaders have come out against laws viewed as hostile to this segment of Americans. Consumers, particularly young ones who tend to be more liberal , expect businesses to take stands on social issues. “Standing for something as a brand is much more important today,” Georgetown marketing lecturer Rohit Bhargava told TIME regarding this trend. LGBT rights “was something that was sort of on fringes and it became totally mainstream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a far cry from when Michael Jordan once allegedly said , \"Republicans buy sneakers too,\" refusing to take sides in a political race. Now the Charlotte Hornets' owner, CNN reported that Jordan was among the NBA insiders who tried to talk to legislators about changing the law. When the news came that the state he grew up in would be losing the game, he expressed disappointment as well as hope that the event might return to Charlotte as early as 2019. The league expressed hope for that too. But that's unlikely to happen if the law stays as it is on the books, which is a warning shot to other cities and states that might consider such measures. \"The NBA doesn’t do anything without thinking carefully,\" says Skidmore's Nathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town itself, unwittingly, tipped the domino that led its own economic loss by passing non-discrimination protections for LGBT residents in February. State lawmakers passed HB2 in response, essentially negating those protections and prohibiting other towns from passing similar ones—while adding a stipulation that in places like government buildings, people must use the bathroom that aligns with the sex on their birth certificate regardless of how they identify. This essentially bans transgender women from those public women's rooms and transgender men from the men's.\n",
      "\n",
      "LGBT rights groups lauded the NBA's decision to move the game but with somber tones, saying that transgender people in North Carolina are suffering and experiencing harassment in public places and schools because of the law. A large-scale survey of transgender people in America found that 59% have avoided public restrooms for fear of harassment, even when their bathroom use hasn't become a central issue in a state's culture wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right-wing extremists called the question here. They said everybody has to take sides about where transgender people go to the bathroom,\" says Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. \"And this is what happened. I’m sure the NBA would rather everything had gone on as normal, just as trans people would have.\" The NBA said the move reflects its value of ensuring \"that all patrons—including members of the LGBT community—feel welcome while attending games and events.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliza Byard, executive director of LGBT youth organization GLSEN, says that this is \"a milestone\" in a \"sea change\" that has been happening in American society, and particularly in professional sports, over the past decade. She laments that homophobia and \"gender-based attacks on your competence\" are still part of sports culture but says the NBA has been a willing partner in promoting inclusion in high school sports. They've hosted clinics for coaches together and put out PSAs. When NBA player Jason Collins came out as gay in 2013, the group almost immediately gave him an award .\n",
      "\n",
      "As awareness about the effects of bullying have spread and high-profile athletes have come out as openly LGBT, Byard says, professional sports has been \"nudged.\" And when a giant shifts its weight, those ripples can be felt far away. As Skidmore College's Nathan says, \"The purchase basketball has on the American consciousness is significant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The purchase basketball has in North Carolina is significant too, even if the threat of moving the All-Star Game couldn't nudge the likes of McCrory. Leading basketball coaches in the state, including Duke University's Mike Krzyzewski, have criticized the law. And while Jordan hopes the game will be back soon, Nathan wonders whether there's more fallout to come at the collegiate level. \"The symbolic power of what the NBA has decided to do here is pretty big,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to know what the long term effects will be. One place to look for lessons is Indiana, which suffered its own PR firestorm after passing a law seen as hostile to LGBT people in 2015. Visit Indy, the state capital's tourism bureau, estimated that the state lost conventions worth an estimated $60 million—and says that 80 more events, small and large, were hanging in the balance. Yet unlike McCrory, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence quickly amended the law to make it clear that it couldn't be used to discriminate against LGBT people. And that saved the city from much greater losses, says Visit Indy's Chris Gahl. \"We empathize with what they’re going through,\" he says of cities like Charlotte. \"You’re stuck, you are helpless to the legislature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gahl says that his organization has been on the phone \"for months\" with counterparts in North Carolina cities, trying to give them advice on how to mitigate the impact of enduring, for instance, a billion negative tweets over the course of a month. He says that the impression unfortunately lingers; when his organization polled executives who might bring events to town several months after the press had died down, 58% of them mentioned the controversy, unprompted. \"Tourism isn't icing on the cake,\" he says, noting that his organization is non-partisan. \"It keeps people working. And the tourism industry as a whole is very LGBT-friendly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next several months at least, the chambers of commerce around the state who have come out against the law have little cause to hope for change. The legislature has recessed until January. In the meantime, state senator Blue says that Democratic lawmakers like him will be working on getting new state leadership elected in November. He describes the current leadership as \"captive\" to the \"extreme right wing\" who have been \"spoiling for a way to retaliate against the LGBT community\" since same-sex marriage was legalized. \"It’s frustrating because North Carolina is not a place that dwells in the cellars of how to discriminate against people,\" says Blue. \"It is a state that generally believes in equality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "NBA players reacted with varying degrees of understanding and chagrin. \"I hope things [change] so that the game can be there at some point. I think those fans in North Carolina deserve it,\" said the L.A. Clippers' Chris Paul. But, he added, \"Some things are bigger than the game.\"\n",
