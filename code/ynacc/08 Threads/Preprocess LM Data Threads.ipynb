Bates Motel looks more American and that notion alone scares everyone.   \n",

Except, if he had NOT stolen a guitar, then he would not have HAD to post bail to begin with. He was not in jail for \"being poor\"....he was there for theft, and rightly so. Next, liberals will say that \"stealing is not a capital crime\"...but he was not \"executed\" for stealing. In fact, he had not even been convicted. He was killed by a couple of other thugs - probably for \"dissing\" them. Yes, this is a tragic situation. No, he should not be dead. However, he is solely responsible for being in the position where he was in jail to begin with. Jails are not happy places - and they are not supposed to be. They are supposed to be places that you avoid going to.   \n",

If I locked up several animals all in one cage and came back some time later to find two of them had mauled and killed one on them I would be held accountable for animal cruelty at the least. I bet no one running this particular zoo ever is held accountable for this death tho.   \n",

As awesome as it would be to bang your hot teacher there is a big downside. Here it goes... Yes, if the relationship is found out she'll go away and you'll be treated like a victim BUT if she gets preggo? The state will start billing you for child support when you turn 18 (if the chick asks for it). That's right, your big \"victimization?\" Well, the state will add insult to (legal) injury. And you don't want to be paying 18 years of child support from 18 years old so I suggest that you, at least, keep some condoms handy the next time you feel like being... a \"victim.\" LOL!   \n",

       "27     I had a gastric sleeve done a couple of years ago. I was about 70 pounds heavier than I wanted to be but couldn't get rid of it via dieting or exercise. I dropped 40 pounds within 3 months but have gained 8 of it back. The doctor PROMISED the surgery would remove the part of the stomach where gherin (the hunger hormone is produced), would likely get rid of the Type II Diabetes and might cause an increase in stomach acid. Yes, the Diabetes went away. So did (unexpectedly and wonderfully) the IBSD. Stomach acid and bile production increased to the point where I have to take 3 GERD meds daily instead of one. Sadly, the hunger hormone production hasn't stopped - in fact, it seems to be worse than ever. And, to top it off, I'm supposed to eat very small meals every 2- 2.5 hours to help keep the acid under control. All things considered, I don't know if I'd do it again.   \n",

You seem to have an attitude toward lower income women and that part I don't understand. When your \"health department is 500 miles away, that is not considered available. Many health departments don't dispense birth control at all but will make a referral to someone who will, IF they accept Medicaid which many doctors don't. But the bigger issue is, why is it your, or the GOP's business if I want to get my birth control from a specific clinic or doctor. Time to stay out of my reproductive health.   \n",

Especially, with all the problems at the State Dept.  I think Bill was turned away when he went barking up that tree.  Anyway, the real losers here are the American public because we have no idea what goes on in these secret instillations and everything is black budgeted.  I have never seen a UFO, alien, or any other mysterious thing.  But, many others have and possibly there are these things out there?  If so, would be nice to know the truth.   \n",

They showed strong ugly opposition to his TTP (Trans Pacific Partnership) and basically booed him and let him know that they weren't falling for his NWO plans.

That 'outsiders' are not welcome into THEIR community.  So instead of FAKING the PC thing, let's look at what happened that night and it's really simple, this young rookie Officer made a TRAGIC MISTAKE and someone was shot.  There was NO intent, reason or racial motivation. It was a MISTAKE, pure and simple.   \n",

He took a life and it was racially motivated.  He would not have had his finger on the trigger if he was patrolling an upper class white building.  He was too scared to do this job and instead of realizing he couldn't do the job, he wound up killing someone.  Also, this isn't China and Asian American groups encompass all the region, not just China.   \n",

First, find work either from home, or perhaps in a place that offers daycare on the premises (it is getting more popular).  Even if you provide child care to others, it is still income (and don't then whine about not being able to use your degree).  Paying even half of your salary to a babysitter, still leaves half in your pocket, making your financial situation a little better.  Second, start making better life decisions.  Jumping from school to school was a bad decision.  Taking out a 21 year loan was a bad decision.  Getting pregnant without the financial resources to cover it, was a bad decision.  Not finding a way to earn a living is a bad decision.  Turn your life around by making smart choices!   \n",

Her story goes on aimlessly but at the end of the day she seems to be at peace with the fact that she's not working.  She doesn't seem to want to work, at least not during her son's formative years.  Not sure why we are all deciding she made bad decisions.  The fact that she found a husband who apparently doesn't mind that they are saddled with her debt and doesn't mind that he's the one who has to go to work to pay it off -- that seems like a pretty GOOD decision for her.   \n",

I went to Medical school in the 80's then did not have children until the 90's after I established my career and was financially stable. Too many millenials whine about student loans. There are plenty of jobs. Choose a career path where you can find one.   \n",

       "25449  My thinking is somewhat similar to Dr. Steve D's, although I sympathize with all of the young people for the huge student loans they are forced to repay. The cost of higher education has gone up far more than the general cost of living index. My daughter will be 44 in August, and she has just paid off her loan for graduate school. She did make some bad decisions that led to this big loan at high interest rates that could not be refinanced, but she paid it off herself and it paid for an education that led her to good jobs.  Granted the woman in the article changed majors and schools and didn't know how to manage money at the age of 18, but that isn't unusual for somebody who is 18 years old. It's unfortunate, but I can understand that happening. It happens a lot.  But what doesn't make any sense at all to me is that at the age of 30, she got pregnant before she had to move out of town for her husband's job, knowing that she wouldn't be able to get another job and knowing that she ow...   \n",

Except, if he had NOT stolen a guitar, then he would not have HAD to post bail to begin with. He was not in jail for \"being poor\"....he was there for theft, and rightly so. Next, liberals will say that \"stealing is not a capital crime\"...but he was not \"executed\" for stealing. In fact, he had not even been convicted. He was killed by a couple of other thugs - probably for \"dissing\" them. Yes, this is a tragic situation. No, he should not be dead. However, he is solely responsible for being in the position where he was in jail to begin with. Jails are not happy places - and they are not supposed to be. They are supposed to be places that you avoid going to.   \n",

As awesome as it would be to bang your hot teacher there is a big downside. Here it goes... Yes, if the relationship is found out she'll go away and you'll be treated like a victim BUT if she gets preggo? The state will start billing you for child support when you turn 18 (if the chick asks for it). That's right, your big \"victimization?\" Well, the state will add insult to (legal) injury. And you don't want to be paying 18 years of child support from 18 years old so I suggest that you, at least, keep some condoms handy the next time you feel like being... a \"victim.\" LOL!   \n",

I was about 70 pounds heavier than I wanted to be but couldn't get rid of it via dieting or exercise. I dropped 40 pounds within 3 months but have gained 8 of it back. The doctor PROMISED the surgery would remove the part of the stomach where gherin (the hunger hormone is produced), would likely get rid of the Type II Diabetes and might cause an increase in stomach acid. Yes, the Diabetes went away. So did (unexpectedly and wonderfully) the IBSD. Stomach acid and bile production increased to the point where I have to take 3 GERD meds daily instead of one. Sadly, the hunger hormone production hasn't stopped - in fact, it seems to be worse than ever. And, to top it off, I'm supposed to eat very small meals every 2- 2.5 hours to help keep the acid under control. All things considered, I don't know if I'd do it again.   \n",

I also had WLS but was in 2003...I lost 197 lbs and gained back 60. Figuring out what to eat after the first bit is hard. I really suggest this book...it's helped me change the way I eat and I'm losing the weight again. And I suggest a therapist.   \n",

Too many people think this is some miracle cure. I know someone who had surgery and she had to go to a years worth of appointments and counseling before she got her surgery. She's been very successful.   \n",

       "222436  First off.. how did the woman her customers KNOW she was gay? why would anyone leave a message like that unless they knew or were told their waitress was gay. And even if she somehow made it known by something she said or did.. it still gives NO ONE christian or otherwise the right to leave a message for a total stranger along with a Bible verse. I am a christian and I do believe that homosexual sex is an abomination just as God has declared and when his first born son Jesus Christ was on earth he never contradicted his fathers command. But Jesus didn't go around talking to people out right about their sexual preferences or if they were committig fornication or adultery. He didn't have to. It was by his loving kindness and caring nature that people that were drawn to him and heard his message decided on their own free will to turn away from their sinful habits and follow him. They made the decision to make changes to their lives because of what he taught and how to treated people. ...   \n",

What would they have done if the waitress had told them she had a child but wan't married?   \n",

If you really studied the scriptures Jesus NEVER went searching out people they came to him because of what they heard about him. Christ had a lot of ministry to get done in only 3 years he had no time for looking for the sinners. He preached, they came and he taught.

Try reading the Bible without any preconceived ideas that you have learned from your \"christian\" religion and you will see that Christ didn't come to force anyone to follow him nor did everyone he met need to have \"demons\" cast out.

She sounds the exact same on all songs she sings., James, yours is not a fair opinion, just a sore looser comment. Both singers were great. Apparently more voters thought Trent earned it., Trent was clearly the winner, according to what the show is all about.
